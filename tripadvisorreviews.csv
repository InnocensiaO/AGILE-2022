8/22/2019,"We kayaked here, but nobody really seems to know how to get to it.  A ranger said via Smith Creek, which we couldn't find, and nobody seemed to know where it was, and the guy at Tomoka Outpost said he wasn't sure but there should be a white post.  I read that there was a landing there and a little bit of a walk.  We got to the end of this shallow water trail and couldn't go any further.  Our gps said that we were close though.",taz321,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Cocoa,Florida,United States,Addison Blockhouse Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews
3/24/2019,"We recently camped at Alafia River in Site 21.  Believe me when I tell you the site is a swamp!  There was even a small boardwalk build around the electric box - I guess so that you don't get electrocuted when connecting?  The park should really close this site down.  It is a mess, and not fair for campers to have to deal with.  Fortunately, we moved to another site the next day and were able to relax and enjoy the park and its amenities.  Camper Coffee get togethers were terrific; hats off to the volunteers who go the extra mile to make the camping experience most enjoyable.  We enjoyed both the basic biking trails and the hiking trails.  The park is working to improve marking the hiking trails, which is good since everyone is not 20-30 something and agile enough to handle the bike trails.  One other note, is that the park really needs to add a laundry.  After a day or two on the trails, we were in dire need to do some wash.",chambersburgj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Fayetteville,Arkansas,United States,Alafia River State Parktripadvisorreviews
11/6/2020,"A 1 day ride.  Plenty of tree coverage and very well marked trails.  Trail maps at park entrance and also well mapped via AllTrails app.  Many great trails, lots of blues and interesting blacks.  Started with green Sand Pine to Rock Garden.  Then Blue Garden Ridge and OAF into Lost Meadow.  Then black Bridges.  Continued to blue Rollercoaster then found blacks StarDust, Gravitron, and Scorpion.  Back to trail head to access south trails, via blue North Creek into Buzzard Bay.  Definitely enjoyed blacks Twisted Sister and Magic Island along the way.  Didnt make it to double blacks Gatorback or Frankenstairs bc of washouts.  Accessed core trails from main Trail Head off of SR-39.  Small park fee ($5).  Main parking area fills up quickly but overflow at campground handles the rest with access to south trails.  Several picnic areas in case of rain at trail head (as well as restrooms).  Quite busy on the weekend and recommend early start times. Only wildlife we saw was a doe and 2 fawns.  And a vulture at the main trail marker LOL. I recommend Deep Woods OFF (not for the vulture but for the mosquitoes).  I STILL highly recommend and will return.",David C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Florida City,Florida,United States,Alafia River State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/27/2020,"This was our 1st mountain biking experience and wow it was amazing!  The trail has  3 to 4 levels of difficulty. He moderate and difficult levels are treacherous- branches hanging over your path, roots and small rocks- not pebbles- rocks, and very narrow paths. The paths, while not only narrow, can be difficult when coupled with a drop off on your right and a dirt wall on your left. Not only are you trying to avoid your pedal hitting the wall but also avoiding rocks on the path. The best thing you can do the first time- slow down and be alert. The second time around you can at least anticipate some of the hazards. Must do's: Download the Trailforks app. We got lost and did circles for a while trying to find the main trail head. The app doesn't require wi-fi to help you know your positioning and navigate. Wear a helmet. Bring plenty of water.  (Parking is in the middle of the 2 main trail areas. We brought a sling type backpack for our water and backups were in the car. The parking area has bathrooms- they were very clean and well kept- and a water fountain. You can refill your water bottle there.)A weather app for lightning detection.  The trails are very shaded with lots of overhang, and its difficult to see inclement weather moving in. It's a cheap day! $5 admission.  In terms of the trails- they were a little scary,  fun and exhausting! Berms, huge inclines and declines, if you're into the intermediate and advanced/expert levels. We spent 2 hours there and that heat takes a lot out of you but its worth it. Lots of riders were there mid day and more coming as we left in the early evening.  So I felt pretty safe being out there with my boys!",beachyanne,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Land O' Lakes,Florida,United States,Alafia River State Parktripadvisorreviews

6/1/2019,"If Gardens appeal to you, this is a great stop! Our family loved it.There are two main areas. One consists of a ‚Äúrec‚Äù pavilion with canoe rentals, covered picnic tables, and small-ish playground for the kids. The other is more the main draw- a manor house with elaborate brick walking paths, immaculate landscaping... and a secret, walled garden!Though we saw it during a time that is not peak blooming season (June vs March), it was still lovely. The bricked walking path to it is easy (note- we are a family of walkers) and the trip is not time consuming. Round trip it was close to three quarters of a mile and we diverged onto a few side paths on the way back to the car. The sloping live oaks draped in moss surrounding the walled garden were almost as imagination-capturing as the garden itself!PROS: Easy walk, interesting and unique, good location (5-8 min from interstate)CONS: Playground on smaller side (not a main draw); trails are not designed for hikes or long walks (if that‚Äôs your interest); LOTS of fire ants (I‚Äôm severely allergic so carry your pen if this is you!)REPEAT?: Yes, def in spring when main house is open and garden is in full bloom",KNMiller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Alabama,Alabama,United States,Alfred B Maclay Gardens State Parktripadvisorreviews

10/8/2019,"We as a family don't visit more than 3-4 times a year, but it's always a good time. Recently we decided to rent kayaks and venture onto Lake Hall. 2 people kayaks were $20 for 4 hours (more than enough time). Plus $6 to get in, which I think is up to 8 people in a vehicle. Kayaks are located right by the lake and equipment is gathered during the check in to the park. Put kayak up when you're done and drop off paddles, life jackets and seats when leaving. You can hang out and swim, fish or just relax after you're done with kayaking. Heck...grill some burgers, dogs or whatever if you choose. We kayaked about half of the lake with a 9 and 11 year old within an hour. We took it very easy and floated with the wind a good bit. Fished, but not seriously and no catches. But during cooler months, spring or without catering to kids it be great.

4/19/2019,I grew up going to the old Cypress Gardens as a kid. Alfred B. Maclay Gardens took me back to that time. We went in April when there is typically an extra charge to see the formal gardens. We went in the evening so the staff let us in with our annual pass. The grounds were beautiful! Giants oaks and magnolias line a brick path. A walled garden reminiscent of the Secret Garden from literature is tucked away. Many squirrels and rabbits run around. We sat for a while and relaxed by the lake. Many flowers were starting to bloom as well making for a beautiful scene.

3/7/2020,"We have been going to Amelia Island at least once each year for the last 30 years.  We often stay at the north end, beyond Atlantic Ave. in rental homes on the beach.  This area is the most secluded and the far north borders on Fort Clinch Park.  Larger rental homes and large condos predominate in the southern end of the Island.  The quaint city of Fernandina Beach is a joy to traverse on an afternoon.  We take our dog and can eat at a variety of spots that allow dogs (typically in outside eating areas).  Karibo is one of our favorites.  Fine dining is also quite available in the city.  Joe's and Le Clos are two of our favorites.  To get a taste of Amelia Island, I would suggest scheduling a night or two at the Elizabeth Pointe Lodge, a wonderful bed and breakfast at the east end of Atlantic Ave.  Roam around and walk the beaches.

The campsites are well maintained but quite close together, and it starts to feel like a bit of a parking lot when full. You have the sense you‚Äôre sleeping out in the suburbs rather than being isolated on a barrier island. The electric hookup is convenient but we happened to be across from a bunch of young people running their ac all night, which, along with their general rowdiness, detracted from the getting away from it all experience. The bugs never really went away, and if you saw anyone hanging out they were usually under the protection of tents. In the summer you probably wouldn‚Äôt want to sleep out without a mosquito net.

It was deep and shady and had plenty of room for a 32' Fifth Wheel and two larger size pick up trucks.  It is right across from the bathrooms also.  We could hear the ocean waves from our site.  This area of the campground is the closest camping sites to the beach. We walked to the beach and hung out numerous times. It is also close to the canoe and kayak area where we launched our canoe one day but it was a liitle too windy to go far.  We biked to the lighthouse which was only 1.5 miles away. We biked the surrounding area a well and it was so neat to see  all of neat historic homes in the area as well as the boats in the marina.  Downtown area is just a few miles away but was a nightmare to get to duing the holiday lights.  The bathrooms in our area of the campground were very clean.  Everyone camping seems very happy with the park and it was nice and quiet after 11pm.  I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this campground and facilities and look forward to coming back.",ANGELA K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fort Myers,Florida,United States,Anastasia State Parktripadvisorreviews
1/4/2021,"Sorry to leave a negative review for this beautiful campground, but our site was right next to a homeless camp. In the four nights that we were there, we experienced people coming and going at all times of the night - either sleeping in a tent or in cars, violent fights and language, drug use, urination in the bushes, and a man pulling down limbs to burn.As much as I tried to have empathy for those down on their luck, this ruined our trip. The rangers? They knew about it but did nothing. The couple on the other side of the homeless camp complained multiple times. At the time (mid December) the site was #22 on the Queen Conch loop, but we overheard them saying they rotate around. We did not feel safe confronting anyone at this site. We are very thankful that our kids are grown so there were no children overhearing and seeing what we experienced those four days and nights. We really hope the rangers will reconsider allowing this to take place when people have no idea what they have just set up next to.Why didn't we move? It's kind of like the school bully whose victims just need to find a new school. How is that helping the problem? So that another family can unpack in the newly empty site - a family with little kids on bikes?",cowgirl41,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Venice,Florida,United States,Anastasia State Parktripadvisorreviews
1/1/2021,"I have visiting many of Florida's state parks, ASP is maintained equally nicely. The size is small, and quickly overpopulates to to the point of being too crowded. There is a nature trail that may be nice for city people, but for those of us who hike in nature, this nature trail is disappointing. There is a path from the watersports booth (about halfway down the mail drive),  which offers an opportunity to do some casual birding. When I was there, there were 50 or more people hammering away at oysters that line the inner waterway, preventing birds from coming too close to shore. The gift shop had sparse merchendise, they also sold simple food, although I did not make any orders. The beach was beautiful, the most beautiful aspect of this state park were the dunes, which suggest how all of Florida's shorelines should appear.",fossilprep,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Kissimmee,Florida,United States,Anastasia State Parktripadvisorreviews
10/17/2020,"We were in town for several days sightseeing in the nation's oldest city.  Living in Hilton Head Island, SC, we are accustomed to beach living.  However, the beach at Anastasia is unlike what we are used to:  uncrowded, secluded with high dunes and tons of tiny shells. We paid the nominal $8 entrance fee and drove through the 139-site water and electric campground first. Tent sites are available.   We full-time in an RV so the campground was a must-see for us.  While the access to the loops is narrow, the sites are all very private and secluded.  There is a dump station available at no charge; 50 amp electric sites are available on the Sand Dollar Loop.  We talked to a ranger who suggested making reservations well in advance because of the recent surge in  camping popularity.  Hot water showers and laundry facilities are available. The park has three picnic areas with tables and restrooms, in addition to three playgrounds.  Pavilions can be rented for groups.  Information is available at the Ranger Station as you enter.   Bicyclists can enjoy more than four miles of beach and several miles of park roads.  We saw three RV's parked on the side of the road while these families biked to the beach or took pictures of a turtle on the side of the road.  With generators running, the park is an ideal spot for families enjoying the RV lifestyle and easy access to the beach.  Commercial enterprises sell beach, camping and fishing supplies and rent canoes, kayaks, sailboats, and stand-up paddleboards.  Anastasia's Bedtime Story Camper Lending Library for campers ages 4-9 offers picture books about the sights and sounds found in the park.  Ask to check out a book at the ranger station.  There area several places to park along the beach including areas to put in a kayak.  We chose to park in a large parking lot with clean bathrooms and a free Wi Fi hotspot area just next to the restroom.  We are accustomed to seeing dogs on the beaches in Hilton Head.  Not so at Anastasia.  Kudos.  If you are looking for a quiet beach with few people and great parking, this is your place.  Expect to find tons of small shells.  Waves are modest.Just prior to the paid entry to the park, you can stop to see the Coquina Quarries on the right.  More than 300 years ago,  the park was busy with workers hauling out blocks of the soft shellstone used to build the Castillo de San Marcos and other buildings.  Coquina (Spanish for ""tiny shellfish"") is a type of limestone composed of sea shell fragments. ",Marnette S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Webster,Florida,United States,Anastasia State Parktripadvisorreviews

2/1/2020,"We spent 4 days camping here in January. Such a well-maintained area and super friendly staff! We had a great time. We very much enjoyed site #24 for tent camping and we did go around to look at all the other sites. Many have quite a bit of privacy - but a few looked very close to each other with minimal to no barriers (trees / bushes / etc) between sites. It is nice that on the Reserve America site you can see some pics of your site as you are selecting which site - so that is very helpful. The bathrooms are kept super clean, shower facilities were nice and we always had at least warm water (and often hot water). The beach is spectacular and so close by! Since we were there during the ‚Äúwinter‚Äù we did not have any bugs at all. As in absolutely zero (other than one mosquito bite the whole time) - that was such a nice surprise! We brought our own kayaks and had no problem parking and getting them into the water - there are a couple of areas you can do so, we chose to go to the Watersports store (where you can rent them too) and it was super easy. If you go to the left when you exit the beach, then you can kayak up to the marina / light house and beyond (we did not go beyond as it was too windy) - if you kayak to the right after exiting the beach you will only have a short distance you can go - BUT - it is very peaceful and calm and there were some beautiful birds we saw in the marshes. So much to do in the short drive to St Augustine. We were a bit bummed that the weather was not great during our short trip - so we actually ended up going into St Augustine every day for a few hours - and really enjoyed many of the sites there - so much history! There is a beach grille store where you can buy some food, ice, firewood (though they were sold out of firewood when we were there - plenty of places within short driving distance where you can buy firewood - Gate gas station and also a large Publix nearby). The hiking trail is very short - but so much walking to do on the 4+miles of beach! Several areas with free WiFi. Electricity at each camp site - that was my first time camping with electricity so felt like a bit of a splurge - but certainly a nice convenience if you want it",mesmith14,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Winter Garden,Florida,United States,Anastasia State Parktripadvisorreviews

Our only criticisms were that we felt rush to be off our site prior to the check out time.. and the road leading into/out of the park is a little rough.

8/3/2019,"We recently returned from a Florida Keys vacation and visited this part twice. We stayed in Marathon and this park was a short drive from the Hampton Inn that we stayed at. The bay side beach is the only one fo the two that is swimmable, the Atlantic side beach is a stinky, seaweed covered mess. Stay away from this side. But the bay side beach has a lots of clear shallow water with patches of sea grass that the kids can stay away from if they choose to. The sea grass beds are shallow and hold quite a few juvenile fish. This is a great place to snorkel for free. You can go further out to the rope line and see full grown barracuda and snook hanging out, but there is a bit of a current out there so you just need be aware of your surroundings and use it to drift in to the shallows (don't fight it).My 5-year old had a great time snorkeling here and got to see fish in the sandy shallows, he was too nervous about going over the grass beds, even the really shallow ones. There are colourful reef fish along the rock walls and some good size snapper in the grass beds. I accidentally approached a nest and one squared up on me. We had a standoff for 20-30 seconds but he and his mate didn't back down so I swam around them in about 5 feet of water.

You can choose between an uncrowded, sandy and mile long Atlantic beach or a calmer protected gulf beach literally 300 yards apart. Bahia Honda is located on a narrow key that separates the Atlantic and the gulf and you have full access to both. The amenities are still being rebuilt from hurricane damage, but are being built according to Florida state park standards, which means they will be excellent. Currently, there are portable trailer restrooms that are adequate. There are freshwater showers and a gift shop and snack bar. There is also a marina with hookups and a wastewater pump-out station. There were jellyfish warnings on the Atlantic beach, so we only played on the gulf side. The entire park is clean and impeccably kept as is normal for Florida state parks. Activities abound. There is a nature center on site we did not visit. You can rent beach equipment and kayaks. They offer snorkel boat tours. You can bike the park roads and take a walk on the old Flagler railroad bridge.

8/3/2019,We were traveling through the Keys and looking for good off shore snorkeling. We chose Bahia Honda because of recommendations and reviews. I will agree the water is absolutely beautiful. At least once you get past the horrendous seaweed on the beach. I realize it‚Äôs natural and necessary but I literally gagged while walking through it. I‚Äôm not going to bash the park because of it but I do want you to be aware of how bad it is until you get to the clear water. The beach we were on had perfectly clear aqua water and then a distinct section of sea grass. We snorkeled all around and saw about 5 small fish. So it‚Äôs nice to wade in but not great for snorkeling. At least where we were (which was the beach on the left when you pull in...not sure of the name). The food was actually pretty good in the snack store. We had subs and we all agreed they were delicious and well priced. Overall it‚Äôs a pretty beach but I‚Äôd take a snorkel boat trip to ensure good snorkeling if we go again.,Georgia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Marco Island,Florida,United States,Bahia Honda State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/5/2019,"This really pains me to write this review, and I‚Äôll start by saying that both the state and national parks in Florida are doing as much as they can with the limited funding that they receive. Hurricane Irma came through in 2017, and the damage that it left is still present almost two years later.We visited this park on our way back from the Keys and planned to snorkel and walk the paths on the old bridge. We scoped out the area before making our decision to skip snorkeling. Temporary bathrooms are in a trailer and it seems like people don‚Äôt know how to flush them. This makes it smell even worse than the seaweed and algae that washes on the shore (and the seaweed smell was BAD). We did read that it helps protect the key, so there is a purpose for it. There are outdoor showers to rinse off and changing rooms.They do have nature talks some of the days. We missed it by a little bit and were kicking ourselves for that. Check their schedule before you go.Ultimately, we decided to skip snorkeling. We had a nice picnic and walked some of the trails up to the old bridge.

6/4/2019,"First of all, let me say that my family loves Bahia Honda, and it is a beautiful family park to explore. The ocean side of the park is breathtaking on a calm day and the other side is a great place for pictures with cool bridges in the background. It is a very scenic park and a fun place to picnic, relax, swim and enjoy the state park experience of our beautiful state! The park is clean, and well-run....except for the contractors who run the dive boat operation! The dive boat out to Looe key provides amazing snorkeling. There is a large, beautiful reef with nice coral formations that provides a home to many colorful species of tropical fish. But to get there, you have to endure a long, ridiculous dive boat crew‚Äôs attempt at comedy and explanation of how to snorkel for literally 30 minutes- even if you are a great snorkeler. We had our extended family on the boat with 5 young children. The operator used bad language in his how to snorkel speech. Like really bad language! I didn‚Äôt appreciate that. He also told the lucky recipients of his colorful speech that most boaters are completely drunk in the Florida Keys. I really took offense to this information because that is incorrect and I think while some boaters tend to make bad choices, the majority of boaters in the keys are in fact sober and recognize the consequences of boating under the influence. I also didn‚Äôt like the fact he was making it seem cool and fun- like everyone boats drunk in the keys - and I didn‚Äôt like him putting that idea in my teenagers heads! But the worst thing about the whole tour is the fact that there was an active bloom of thimble jellyfish larva in the water and he knew about it and allowed everyone to get in! This common phenomenon causes sea bather‚Äôs eruption (google it) and professional dive boats and even beaches warn snorkelers about it. I have a pretty extensive knowledge of marine biology and would have chosen not to swim, but now I am covered with stings on day one of my vacation. The guide warned people of ‚Äúlittle crabs and shrimp that may bite‚Äù but told our children multiple times not to worry about the stings. They could proudly go home and tell their friends ‚ÄúTHEY CAUGHT CRABS IN THE KEYS!‚Äù Literally I‚Äôm not kidding. He told the 9-year-old 3 times to go home and say he caught crabs. This is completely unacceptable. I would recommend a proper training for the dive boat crew and a quick refresher of marine biology basics and a bit more common sense of what not to say on a mixed age dive boat with families.

12/1/2020,"This is one of the few places in the Keys where you can get white, soft sand with swimming.  When we visited, it was swim at your own risk due to bacteria levels.  If you have any open cuts, you need to avoid swimming.  They test weekly.  That is probably a standard plan, but I'd think if there was a positive test, you'd check again sooner.  The lady at the gate said it changes frequently.  This state park offered no brochures, due to Covid, however other state parks did offer brochures and took $ by hand so this wasn't a state rule.  We visit a lot of state parks and national parks and generally talk to so many rangers that are excited to tell us more about the park and area.  Many things were closed but we asked a ranger about some plants growing.  He grumpily answered us.  Another gentlemen approached with questions about the 7 mile bridge and he kind of just blew him off.  He really acted like all of us should know the answers already.  I was disappointed in that behavior.  This is a tourist area so they should expect people to have questions.  I'd think they'd be excited people care.

9/5/2020,"The pictures are deceiving.  The beach area is no where as large as it appears in all the promo material.  We found more beach space at Fort Zachary Taylor in Key West.  That said, it is one of the nicest, clearest areas to swim  in the keys.  Go early, its a small park and they close to new people when it gets full which it does between 12-2 most days.  We enjoyed visiting.  Walked around to look at different angles of the old derelict railroad bridge.  There's a gift shop and a $40 snorkel tour you can book from there, one of the cheapest deals in the Middle Keys.

We paid the park fee and easily found parking on the ocean side. We were shocked to see so much seaweed on the beach. Lots of people enjoying the beach, water, and picnic area. We walked under the bridge to the gulf side where the beach, water, and picnic areas were much more crowded.

4/14/2019,"As you enter the Bahia Honda State Park, you will be welcomed by a sign saying that it was voted the best beach in America in 1992. Well, friends, it sure isn‚Äôt 1992. Pros: the ladies at the snack bar were nice, and for snack bar food, it wasn‚Äôt bad. Moving on, let‚Äôs talk about access. There is one portion of the beach where you have to climb over a big rocky wall to get to and from the beach. My mom and I are both nursing knee injuries, so we didn‚Äôt even consider it, but I would have found it unpleasant even if my knee was okay. A bit Further along, there is a beach with little paths cut into the rocks. This was still a bad option for injured knees, because it was pretty steep, but we went with it, because it was the best choice of the ones we had.So, you finally get to the beach, and it is covered, I mean COVERED in insane amounts of washed up seaweed. You have to find one of the little patches without seaweed to set up, and your five year old will likely shriek in horror as they attempt to cross the seaweed to get to the water. I don‚Äôt mind it in the water. I don‚Äôt mind some of it on the beach, but almost every bit of the beach was covered, and in some places it was quite thick. Speaking of the water, it‚Äôs basically a foot deep unless you go way way out.  The deepest spot within the marked swimming area came up to my husband‚Äôs waist.  This might work well for the aforementioned five year old, but adults have to sit in the water, army crawl around, or stand in the water that only goes up to your shins. Today, there was quite a bit of wind, so the water was knocking us around in our seated positions. I love swimming in natural bodies of water, but I just gave up after a short period of time, because it was really unenjoyable to just sit there and be knocked over repeatedly. The wind and current also meant that it wasn‚Äôt great for snorkeling, but it‚Äôs always the case that you can‚Äôt count on Mother Nature to cooperate with you about these things. Lastly, they have a place where you can rent beach chairs, and the price to rent is something like $9 a chair. I have never in my life seen such a crappy beach chair. The frame was made of thin plastic tubing and a little piece of cheap, thin fabric.  There was only one position - reclining backwards. So, if you‚Äôre on the beach to tan, it might work for you, but if you want to read or gaze out on the water, too bad. One chair was already broken when we set it up, and we broke the other one just trying to sit in it.  As we were leaving, I said to my husband, ‚Äúman, I wish we had come in 1992!‚Äù",Amaya H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Takoma Park,Maryland,United States,Bahia Honda State Parktripadvisorreviews

The gift shop has lots of cute items for purchase and we were able to rent a snorkeling mask for $5 and purchase the snorkel for $5. The snorkeling right off the shore was amazing!

6/26/2019,"I naively thought the FL Keys had great beaches...once in Key West I realized how wrong I was.  Luckily a friend had recommended Bahia Honda and I was not disappointed.The park entrance is located between mile marker (MM) 36 and 37.  The sign is small; the good news is that there is a bridge immediately before/after it (depending where you‚Äôre coming from).The park has a building with a food concession, a gift shop, showers, restrooms and an Activities Desk where you can rent or buy kayaks, snorkel gear, umbrellas and chairs. We rented chairs and umbrellas. They also offer snorkel tours.There are two beaches: Calusa, on the bay side and Loggerhead, bordering the Atlantic sea. The former is small and shallow, great for kids. When we went it was free of seagrass so that‚Äôs the one we selected. Loggerhead is significantly larger.

5/11/2019,"It's at Mile Marker 37 - not a lot of signs to say ""Bahia Honda State Park - this way""!. Hint, Southbound to the Key West and drive over the 7mile bridge - you missed it.  Northbound from the Key West - just after the 7Mile bridge and windup in Ohio Key or Ohio - you missed it, but that's understandable.    It is really nice and there is a beach!  Calusa has sand, 5 meters wide along the water with a view that pics are made for.  Also have grills and places to explore, walk the Old Bahia Honda Bridge.  LoggerHead is another beach just opposite of Calusa.  Different feel and texture, LoggerHead is on the Atlantic side, more seagrass and waves, where Calusa more Gulf side and protected. One thing you have to do is take the tour - it's free. Volunteers run it to inform and show what Hurricane Irma did to the park and how it destroyed the Sandspur Beach and campgrounds and what is being done to restore.  The tour alone was worth the price of State Park admission - without Calusa beach or buying an additional snorkel trip to Looes Key.",vkingta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Utica,Michigan,United States,Bahia Honda State Parktripadvisorreviews

We saw 2 lobsters hiding under a rock, a moray eel, tons of spiky sea urchin tucked inside rocks, crabs and hermit crabs inside big conchs and spotted sea slugs.  Bring water shoes!  My son and I had fun building sand castles with all the unique types of shells and seaweed to decorate.  We watched the sunset and it was beautiful.

12/20/2019,"This used to be an awesome place to go to. My eighty year old mom and my kids used to spend at least 3 days a week here every December, January, February, March, April. Hurricane Irma has turned Bahia Honda into a moonscape.  As of  December 2019, only tiny fraction of this park is opened, and there is no urgency to restore. Gone are any SHADY picnic areas- so you  will bake in the sun in a tiny  piece of park that is opened. They offer you tours in trolley to show you  places which you aren't allowed to go to. There are lots of rangers driving around aimlessly in golf carts (???) waisting time and gas, instead of planting trees and working on restoration. We all stopped going. It is a disgrace. Also, the bridge walk is blocked off in a weird way- so you cant see the old bridge from the top.

3/4/2021,There‚Äôs just something about this place. I‚Äôve been here many times over the years & love it every time. We‚Äôve tried getting campsite reservations for feb 2 years in a row without success. I‚Äôll keep trying. I usually pick which side to set up on depending on roughness of water. I mostly end up on gulf side. The swimming on that side can be scary so watch your kids. We had to rescue a little girl that the current swept away in her tube & got caught up on the safety rope. Now I know why that rope is there. She was prob only 9 or 10. The current was so strong we couldn‚Äôt even swim. We had to use the rope to pull ourselves out to her. My husband got rope burns from the save. No one ever even noticed she was missing.

Could it be the seagrass underneath,  or the birds taking turns sizing you up? Perhaps it is the way the park is situated on a peninsula,  giving everyone a choice to make their spot special.  All I know is that I felt obliged to wave to the little yellow plane that occasionally passes, and somehow didn't care that he didn't wave back.This spot is a fantastic natural area for all day watching, while floating in the water.

If you are tent camping, make sure to bring a fan for both night/day and also make sure to bring some type of shade- some spots have some natural shade, but some really have none. We loved fishing under the bridge and could see so many fish in the water. Saw 2 sharks as well. They have snorkeling right from the park. Unfortunately, it was too windy when we went and our trips were cancelled (nothing can be done there). We still had fun with the snorkel gear in the ocean and saw a good amount of fish.

The reef is gorgeous and we saw a shark, a sea turtle, and lots of fish as well as a variety of interesting coral. The boat trip out to the reef is lovely too, so that adds something special to the snorkeling trip. The trip is reasonably priced for the boat trip out and back and 90 minutes of snorkeling, and they rent all the equipment on site if you need it, including corrective masks for people without perfect vision. Captain Brian and our Dive Master Zac were upbeat, helpful, and safety-conscious, taking the time to review all safety procedures and give us information on the reef. Zac made a point of going around and talking to each of the 13 people on board to make sure he understood comfort level, experience with snorkeling and to answer questions. He also gave a short clinic on snorkeling for inexperienced folks. I noticed they spent the entire time we were snorkeling watching the water carefully and keeping tabs on all snorkelers, so if you have children (there were some on the tour) or you are nervous, you can rest assured that they care enough to pay close attention. I was concerned about coming up the ladder after snorkeling because of recent knee surgery and Zac assured me he could change the angle of the ladder and assist me as needed. We had a load of fun, saw lots of great marine life, enjoyed the boat ride, and felt like we were taken care of.

You get there and get a huge whiff of something that smells like sewage. It‚Äôs the sea grass that‚Äôs making the Keys smell like a giant toilet. I understand it is good for the environment to not get rid of it but like if it‚Äôs a well known state park I would expect them to keep it at a lower level than so built up on the shores rotting where everyone sits. If you really wanna go here wear WATER SHOES!!!! I made the mistake of thinking the Keys would be reefs and smooth white sand but nope, sea weed and who knows what else.

During our visit only portable toilets were available. A nearby bathhouse hadn't been completed despite a lengthly construction period.

5/14/2019,"First of all, Keys beaches are not CA or FL beaches with long stretches of soft sand. Most of them have a very short sand area, and Bahia Honda's is the best of all of them for beaching and snorkeling, I swear. There's a 'Calusa Beach' area which faces the bridge and bay, and is very protected. Gets to about 4 feet before sea grass begins, with virtually no current. You have kids and want to lay in a sandy bit, go here. You can snorkel above the grass, and by a very shallow rocky area, but as far as I can tell, it's 95% sea grass. So, kind of dull. I saw a pair of hogfish and a few solitary swimming fish. Loggerhead Beach is on the southern and farthest west side, and is restored now. There are picnic tables along a hard-surface walkway, some low sandy dunes with interesting dune plants, and a very long stretch of sandy beach. The caveat--there's often dead sea grass on the beach. So if you want to lay there, you need to be aware there's a smell. It honestly kind of reminds me of shellfish, briney and mildly stinky. But who cares, because this is absolutely the best place in the Keys for shore-entry snorkeling. There is a current out by the channel/westernmost spot, so you should be a decent swimmer if its high tide and mildly windy. But it is so worth it. Day one--I saw manatees, which are apparently rare there. Day two--a yellow stingray. Both days: Pinfish, hogfish, goliath grouper, porkfish, Sargent major, purple sea rods, a giant anemone, parrotfish, white scroll algea. People around me saw a dolphin, which I missed because my head was in the water. A few people try to fish, which imo is stupid. The fish were on the small size for their species, and not wildly plentiful.It is showing some of the algae overgrowth that is plaguing the Keys. Climate change  is real. But still, for $4.50, (single person), a great experience.Restrooms are still temporary, in a very nice trailer. Showers are also temporary, but solid. Dive shop/gift shop is nice. There's a nature station that was only open once, the three or four times I tried to stop by. You can see some of the stuff you are looking at in the water. There's a nice butterfly habitat restoration, and the walk up to the (broken) bridge is kind of fun but short. Nice stretch of beach to walk though. Not much for collecting, along tideline (unless seagrass), but if you snorkel, there's a lot of half-clam shells underwater.Rangers are nice and plentiful. Parking is fine. There is very little shade--scrub trees only--so probably bring your own.",Beachtraveler,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Madison,Wisconsin,United States,Bahia Honda State Parktripadvisorreviews
4/17/2019,"We spent several hours over 2 days at Bahia Honda.  The first day, we were there at low tide when the water was very calm and very little wind. My husband and I were able to walk up & down the beach several times and we saw so many fish swimming along the shoreline including some gar and a sizable stingray. We enjoyed our couple hours there so much, we decided to spend a few hours there the next day before leaving the Keys. Our second trip, it was more windy & high tide. We tried swimming for a bit, but the water wasn‚Äôt very deep or clear and there are some sizable dips in the sand that make it hard to navigate. There definitely is a large amount of sea grass on the beach which some people find irritating, but there is a reason that it‚Äôs there.  In spite of that, we were able to lay on the beach and then walked up the path to the bridge. Until then we‚Äôd had no idea there was a beach on the gulf side too! That side was much more calm. It was too bad we had to leave or we would‚Äôve spent some time there. We made a brief stop into the gift shop/snack bar and the souvenirs being sold looked to be of good quality.  Many people don‚Äôt realize that sandy beaches are few and far between in the Keys.  It‚Äôs clear that Bahia Honda is still recovering from Hurricane Irma, but it‚Äôs definitely worth checking out in the meantime and spending your dollars there to support getting it back to where it once was.",BethAnnMKE,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Milwaukee,Wisconsin,United States,Bahia Honda State Parktripadvisorreviews

I don't think a lot of visitors do their research before coming here and, because they don't, they have unrealistic expectations.  A beach is a sandy strip of land on the water, so technically there is a beach here, but you are not going to THE beach.  You will need to go elsewhere with your boogie boards and boom boxes.  The bay meets the gulf here, and you won't see the sparkling waters found further down the Forgotten Coast.  What you WILL find here is unspoiled Florida, both on the water and hiking in the woods.  This is a nature santuary...sea turtles nesting, crabs procreating, sharks, dolphins and alligators are all on the beach side.  I have seen mama deer with their fawns, bucks, raccoons, rabbits, foxes, bobcats, coyotes...all in the beautiful pine forests.  My husband has seen bears while kayaking through the park.  And the birds!  Sea birds, owls, hawks, bald eagles (where Bald Point gets it's name) songbirds...too many to mention.  Monarch butterflies migrate here.  Bring your camera.

If you exit that portion of the park and continue down towards Alligator Point, you will come to the second left hand turn where the main part of the park is located.  There are boardwalks to walk and some other trails.  Most lead to the beach, which is a lovely spot to walk and see pelicans perched on sandbars.  It is also a nesting area for horseshoe crabs and we saw some small horseshoe shells.  The admission is $4 per car and it's on the honor system, although a park ranger is nearby to help.

Make sure you teach children not to take the shells they find, instead show them the hermit crabs tucked deep inside or you might find their shells trying to walk away! There are either clean bathrooms or portable toilets for use depending on where you park. The park trails aren't marked as well as they could be but they are well walked so even if you get a bit confused you should eventually find a colored marker to find your way out.

We caught mess of whiting and some flounder that were too small to keep.  In the afternoon, we kayaked Tucker Lake to see the birds and fished the creek connecting the lake to Ochlocknee Bay.  A few days later he gulf was too rough to kayak fish off the beach at our cabin on Alligator Point so we went back to Bald Point and launched the kayaks from the beach next to the fishing pier.  My wife sat under the shade tree and watched us catch some nice slot reds out in the bay (even on the bay side, the wind was so strong she chose not to go out in her kayak).

6/27/2020,"We came here to camp because of social distancing during the pandemic. I‚Äôm so glad we did! What a treasure!The park has several neat hikes best done around sunrise or sunset during the summer. There is a 4-story observation tower that we took advantage of two nights for glorious sunsets. On our last night I saw several other trails from the observation area so we plan to return.The campground is quiet, with mostly private sites. We enjoyed taking advantage of staying over night to take the trails. There is a small resident alligator which my 4 year old loved. They rent kayaks, but I saw some campers bring their own & do a lovely sunset kayak trip in the lagoon. There is a private beach along the intercoastal waterway, which we spent time at one day while my son collected snails & hermit crabs. If you don‚Äôt mind the 5 minute car ride, you can visit beautiful Johnson‚Äôs Beach in the National Seashore on the Gulf of Mexico. We have an America the Beautiful pass, so our visit to Johnson‚Äôs Beach was free. It is normally $25 per car. However, there are several free Gulf beaches all around.

If you, however, are not from the area and want to see a different landscape, the boardwalk trails provide you with that option. The cost to enter the state park for the purpose of day-use is $4.00 per vehicle/1 person, or $6.00 per vehicle/2-8 people. Lavatories are available.

2/28/2021,"We enjoyed our camping experience at Big Lagoon State Park.  We took a walk on the boardwalk and enjoyed watching frogs in the bog.  When we arrived at the end of the boardwalk, it was closed off for repairs.  We learned that the East Beach area was closed but the West Beach was open. We took a short ""hike"" there on the sand trails.  Only a few visitors were there so we enjoyed the solitude.  We spotted a heron near the water.  Damage from Hurricane Sally prevented us from enjoying the entire park, but workers are working to restore damage.  This park is beautiful and still need some tender loving care.  It just takes time.  This is all part of nature and we accept the current conditions.  Our campsite was in a wooded area across from the restrooms and shower facilities which were always very neat and clean.

8/8/2019,"Between the Gulf shore state park in Alabama and Big Lagoon state park in Florida, I would say Big Lagoon wins hands down for camping, beach access and tranquility. One can chill out at the InterCoastal Waterway beach itself with the super calm water, or drive out to the Perdido Key to access the Gulf beach. The beach at Perdido Key was clean and practically empty of people, it was tremendously fun for us to have the beach almost to ourselves. Plus we didn't have to pay extra for beach access since it was included in the camping fees at the state park. Considering how commercialized the beaches are, Big Lagoon is a gem for those who would like the less crowdedness.Morning walks to the watch tower to catch the sunrise, and then exploring the trails and boardwalks, was what I enjoyed as a daily routine. While on the tower, it is easy to spot the mullets by the shore, it is a very serene experience there.The naval aviation museum is a wonderful place to hang out during the day. The free entrance was a great way to spend the day in the cool a/c, learn about the the navy and then head out to the gulf beach when it was cooler.

11/14/2019,"What a wonderful afternoon! We entered through the Big Shoals entrance and went down the dirt road which was well-maintained. The parking lot is paved and there are nice, clean restrooms before you head down the trail. We ate our lunch at one of the half dozen or so picnic tables and then headed down the trail with our dog. The trail is just beautiful: well-shaded and serene, right along the riverbank. Not many elevation changes, but there are exposed roots and some stretches that were covered in pine needles and could possibly be slippery. I don't recommend flip flops, but laced sneakers should be just fine. There were even a couple complimentary walking sticks available at the entrance. :) As we got closer to the shoals, we could actually HEAR the water - not a typical sound in flat Florida! The water was low, which didn't make for rapids but made for a series of very small waterfalls that were soothing and so enjoyable.

The trail offers great wildlife spotting opportunities, we stopped a while to watch a Pileated Woodpecker do its thing. The Boneyard Beach once you get there is quite surreal, with all the dead trees scattered on the beach and in the water.

9/4/2020,"The stunning colors of Florida perform in synchronicity in this unspoiled gem of a park. Crabs dancing and even jumping from the water in shades of orange and blue. Dragonflies dance among the wildflowers in their best bright blue attire along  white-sand beaches littered with soft driftwood and stones that meet the oceans lapping waves.  I'm excited about this park.  As you pull into the carpark, beauty awaits as the welcoming shade of towering oak trees envelopes you in what feels like a secret garden.  There is scenic picnic area in the middle of the parking lot  with many picnic tables shaded by towering oak trees, such a beautiful spot to soak in the beautiful forest and listen to the singing birds and insects without even hitting the trails. However the trails are a must for those able. The path is wide and meanders to an opening of breathtaking, virgin beach.  We rode our bikes, however walking is probably even better to really soak in the cacophony of native Florida fauna showing off along the way.  Explore the beach on foot, in your chair, with you eyes, with your ears; smell it taste it , feel it, take it with you when you leave!   We had a great time exploring on foot, going left from the trail toward the bridge of bustling cars  there is an interesting wetland area filled with feathered waders poised with their eyes focused on the mirrored water where they pluck nibbles out with amazing speed, grace and accuracy.  During our visit we were treated with a bright pink Roseate Spoonbill; a visual feast. There were also many orange and blue crabs in the shallows that we dubbed ""gator crabs"" in recognition of UF Gators who sport the same colors in nearby Gainesville.  Careful they jump!  Next we biked to Blacrock or Boneyyard beach, depending who you ask to see a  beach unlike any other this Florida Crackers has ever experienced. The shoreline looks like a rocky uplift though these rocks are not what they seem and are actually made of sandy; interesting indeed.

2/22/2020,We visited Big Talbot Island SP on a cold day in February. We hiked out to Boneyard Beach where the ocean and storms have brought down many trees making them look like giant bones. The wind was blasting the beach and the surf was impressive. Make sure to check the tide times as at high tide the water can push up to the bluffs potentially cutting off parts of the beach. There isn‚Äôt much heading north up the beach. I recommend heading south down the beach as that was were the most impressive trees were. It was fun trying to find paths through the trees. It was a most impressive sight to see. There were a number of dogs on the beach (there are rules in place prohibiting dogs on the beach) and some of them were chewing on the driftwood.

4/1/2019,"I quickly looked it up online and mistakenly thought it was ""dog friendly"" what I didn't catch from the summarized result which says at the top that it's dog friendly is that your dog can only be on the trails and not on the beach. The reason for this which is very understandable is the nesting birds. This review is targeted toward going to the driftwood beach portion of the park but the no dogs on the beach goes for the entire Big Talbot Island as I understand it. Unfortunately I didn't catch the ""trails only"" part and we drove up for a trip out to the beach to see the trees and do a little bit of fishing. Don't forget to take $3 cash for the road side parking and if your taking very much to the beach with you a wagon would be a good idea. Also the drop down to the beach from the trail may be hard for older folks. It does take like 10 - 15 minutes to walk from the parking to the beach but it's well worth the effort as the beach is very photogenic.",Glenn H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jacksonville,Florida,United States,Big Talbot Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

That added to the eeriness of the place. Such a cool area to see and explore. As mentioned earlier, parking is $3 cash (put in envelope).

There are two ways to the beach. I was going north towards Amelia Island. The first entrance was noticeable by the do not park signs all along the roadway. This entrance has about 4 or 5 parking places. Not enough for the beach‚Äôs popularity! It has the easiest access to the beach. The second entrance has more parking, picnic areas, lookout point and porta-potties. There is also a trail that will take you to the beach.

The park is very easy to find, just stay on the road from Miami until you arrive at the gates to the park. Park admission is $8.00 per car with up to 4 people. There are a lot of trails to explore and hike, but they are not marked very well. We parked near the lighthouse and then walked to No Name Harbour, looping back along the water. Total time 1hour walking, flat and relatively easy.

5/16/2019,"When we went in February the lighthouse area closed at 4:00 pm (although perhaps later in the season it is open longer), so we missed out on that area this time.  You can still get relatively close to the lighthouse for photos, but not within the immediate area.  But, if your primary purpose is just to take a look at the scenery - it is interesting in all directions - and not spend the day swimming, picnicking or fishing (all of which are possible), if you arrive one hour prior to closure of the park, the admission fee is half-price, at $4.00, per car.  In terms of planning your trip to this park, note that you are driving through some congested areas that may slow you down a bit, and it is particularly congested when people are returning from work in Miami.",Marshall B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Ferney-Voltaire,Auvergne-RhÙne-Alpes,France,Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Parktripadvisorreviews

So much that we made plans to go back the next day. We were there on a weekend and although there ended up being a lot of people I would not use the word crowded at all. The beaches were very clean and we saw people walking to pick up the little bits of trash that were left from rude people. The water was nice, almost warm actually. There is a fishing part along the sea wall that has nice views. There‚Äôs a pretty lighthouse there as well. There are several hiking and nature trails. We saw raccoons in the evening trying to get the scraps left over from BBQs and we saw literally dozens of iguanas in the morning right off the beach sand. Everyone we encountered were respectful and friendly with the wildlife. This was such a beautiful park. If you can, you should make the time to go. Also a tip for beach goers/swimmers...we found the easiest access was shelter 2, beach access 4. This had the easiest walking path as it has a bridge for the majority of the path to the sand so you don‚Äôt have to trudge through as much of the sand. This is also the path we saw the most iguanas.

The raccoons roaming the park are certainly not afraid of anything so be careful because they certainly will approach you.

You drive to the end of the road and park so you can walk to the lighthouse. When you park, you find a restroom in case you need it. Walk along the gravel road and you'll smell the ocean and see different people fishing for their dinner. The vegetation is rich on one side and the calm ocean engulfs you with its beauty. At the end of the road you hit the lighthouse and the recreated houses of former coast members. You can physically walk up to the lighthouse and around the area. Nice pictures can be taken on the other side of a fence and on the jagged rocks infront of the structure. With good balance and safety, you can see manatees next to these rocks.

We took the B route from Brickell on the bus and were dropped off at the stop right in front of the park in Key Biscayne after ~20mins! After a short walk into the park, you pay $2/person and continue towards the lighthouse and beach. We set up camp on the beach close to the water and it was very quiet and relaxing by the time we got there (~12:30pm). There are also bathrooms and showers right next to the beach (just wish the changing area in the bathroom was a bit more private). We left our stuff and walked around a bit, down towards the lighthouse. They let 8-10 people up at once, but the line went quickly. It was a beautiful view from the top-- you can see the city and the beach. One thing to note is that it is quite high and there is little space between the railing and the lighthouse itself on the lookout, so if you are very afraid of heights or get bad vertigo, this might not be for you. We didn't eat at the lighthouse cafe, but it looked like it had delicious, fresh and cheap seafood!

However like many of the beaches right now, the seaweed is a huge problem. I understand it‚Äôs healthy for our ecosystem but it smells awful due to it rotting on shore of the beaches.

The tour was informative and the view from the top of the lighthouse was gorgeous. We also ate lunch at the Cafe which was a nice meal for such casual dining.

On a very quiet weekday the guy said it would reopen at 1:00 (it was 10:50 and people were up in it) so after our long walk we never got to see it at 1:30 or so. Too crowded (they limit it to 10 people at a time). Bummer. A Pepsi (can) & an ice tea (very small) was $5 which I felt a tad overpriced. Has a nice asphalt trail for cycling around the loop.

The river is refreshing and a beautiful spot for a swim, but it was insanely busy, especially considering the nearby manatees resting in the river's edge.

10/1/2019,"Interesting spot, better a little later than we went in late September, once the St. John's river water cools and the manatees come in for the temperate water. The river water carries more tanins and so is darker like tea.  The spring water is easier to see through, so if you're lucky enough, you may see a manatee making its way up toward the source of the spring.  Part way up is a large area to swim in, but you're not supposed to interact should any of the manatees enter the area (if they come to you??). Definitely cool water for me, but really refreshing in the heat.",Jill H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Pickering,Ontario,Canada,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
5/23/2019,"First, I should talk about the park. This was a wonderful three nights when it comes to nature.  Even though it is not manatee season, we spotted two plus alligators, deer, variety of birds, a visiting raccoon, and lots of different species of fish.  We swam and snorkeled at the spring.  The water was a bit chilly but once you are in, it is lovely and very clean.  Lots of picnic areas and parking.  Hiking is wonderful and the boardwalk along the creek and spring is wonderful.  Also, knowledgeable volunteers around to chat with.Okay, now the cabin.  All in all, it was pretty good but lacked a few essentials.  The positives:  Very clean.  Lovely screened-in porch with rocking chairs and picnic bench.  Picnic bench also outside. Kitchen had newer stove, fridge and microwave. Had a dishwasher which I was not expecting so pleasant surprise. Great water pressure and plenty of hot water.  Cabin area was quiet and neighbours were all quiet.The negatives: We only had three spoons.  The BBQ had a hole in it, so only half was usable.  The mattresses were uncomfortable.  You might want to bring a good three inch topper. and your own pillows.  Our mattress was vinyl covered and the springs went ""boing"" every time you moved.  Reminded me of the old cartoons.  Towels were very old.  Only had unfitted sheets.  But I know it is kind of like camping, but my back hates uncomfortable beds.It was still wonderful if you are a nature lover, hiker, or swimmer (we are all three).  We just needed to be more prepared for the three nights but as it was one of several stops, we could not fit everything in the car.Add to your list- pillows, mattress topper (unless you don't mind hard beds), folding chairs for around the campfire, extra cutlery.Still enjoyable overall.",TerriG55,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Peterborough,Ontario,Canada,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

You can find out ahead of time if they‚Äôve counted any in the park, or you can take your chances.  On our visit, it had been in the 80s for better than a week and was still in the 70s, so the river itself was probably pretty warm, so we didn‚Äôt see any.  Park has lots of green spaces, boardwalks along the river with viewing spots, picnic areas, lots of kiddie play stuff, and the surviving mansion of the first white settlers to skim cash from the area via orange/citrus groves.  Also in the park is a well-done private-company boat tour of the river, as well as canoe and kayak rentals.  There‚Äôs a concession stand.  Everything is well-maintained and worth a visit for the scenery even if the sea cows don‚Äôt make an appearance. All in all, a really diverse and well-equipped state park.",Jayboy4,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sanford,Florida,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

We heard that most days during the WINTER (when the manatees come for the warmth of the 72 degree spring fed water), is always crowed. In the summer, you can swim and play in the springs, but I think then, most of the manatees have left. We saw one HUGE alligator. Lots of birds. Interesting historic home (circa late 1800s) with lots of history. Picnic tables, Grills. Boat tours of the Saint John River twice a day (was closed for Christmas). About half a dozen cabins for rent, but we stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in Deland about 20 minutes away. $6 entry fee per car.

11/5/2019,"Used to come to Blue Springs Orange City (yes, in Florida, when you say ""Blue Springs"" you must add the location since there are dozens of Blue Springs here) for scuba classes and a great dive experience.  In the many years since my last visit, I immediately noticed the expansions and improvements.  Designated campsites and cabins are a real plus.  If I had to guess, I would say there is a bit more parking than before.  Gate guard was very friendly and the whole park was well kept and maintained.  The old viewing area is gone, but still has good views from the boardwalk.  One somewhat depressing parts was to see an information sign that said the output from the spring was 55 million gallons of water a day.  That still qualifies it as a major spring, but in the early 1980's it was almost double.  This points to the increasing negative consequence of more population sinking wells to get water.  It is one of the best manatee viewing spring runs in Florida during the winter.",mbd_mj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Orlando,Florida,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

7/2/2019,"Upon laying eyes no the river, we were all is absolute AWE of the magnificent natural landscape along with the monstrous fish perfectly visible in the crystal clear waters. We began our visit with some fishing off the designated fishing dock where we had to pause as we enjoyed a visit from a few large manatees and a rescue Manatee pup. Next was the adventurous swim upriver to the actual spring. I absolutely and HIGHLY recommend bringing along your Snorkel gear (mask, snorkel AND FINS). Swimming upstream would have been quite a struggle. Observing the fish underwater was a blast. Other visitors rented tubes and would walk on the boardwalk up to the furthest tube launching dock and enjoy floating downstream. There is also a food court with available food. Be sure to get their early - this park can get full and there may be a waiting time to get in. The park is extremely well kept and quite a magical experience to feel the water gushing out from deep below.

7/1/2019,"This was our first visit to any spring in the state of Florida. We had heard from friends that many of the Florida Springs were great and finally had a chance to visit one, during our recent trip to Daytona Beach. Location: The spring is located in Orange City, about 35 minutes drive from Daytona Beach. Using GPS, it was easy to find, although located in a more desolate, ""off the main path"" area. After reading so many reviews, we made a point to arrive early, to avoid the lines. This proved to be a good decision as we had no line to wait upon our arrival at 9am. Parking was easy to find and we quickly made our way to check out the spring trail and rent our equipment.Staff:Staff at the gift shop was friendly, and helpful. They provided us with information and guidance on choosing the necessary gear for our swim down the stream. The staff (manatee volunteers) at the spring entrance were also very nice, and informative. They are there to both protect the animals, as well as educate the crowds.Springs:As my title suggested, this is a great starter spring. The spring is not very big and highly manageable, especially if you go with kids. You can either float or swim upstream to the boil (which takes probably less than 15 minutes) , and the water is shallow enough at most points where you can walk, if needed. It's also clear enough where you can definitely see most things underwater. There's plenty of wildlife to see, including Gar, Tarpon, Birds, Frogs, and much more. We were very very LUCKY to have encountered 3 manatees during our visit in June (not very common). They were literally swimming next to us (AMAZING!) by the platform. The volunteers did a great job in protecting them and preventing the crowds from intruding on their space. We also saw many fish in the water. At the boil, you can also swim deeper down and see a pretty cool entrance to where the spring flows out from. If you are interested in seeing the wildlife, we strongly suggest you rent the snorkel and mask. Trails:After completing the spring swim, we hiked the small trail and got to see the boil from the top. It was a pretty neat experience and the pathway distance was short enough where everyone in our party was able to manage (4 year old- 40 year old). We then returned to the gift shop area and sat at one of the picnic tables to eat our lunch. By then, the park had already closed to capacity, so we were very happy we went early.All in all, we had a great time. As our primary purpose was to experience the spring, we felt very satisfied with the park. There were many other pathways and additional amenities that we didn't get to try out, but we're pretty sure they would be great too.",Jennifer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Miami,Florida,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/10/2019,"We live a short distance from Blue Springs State Park, and have visited this State Park on more than 10 occasions.  If you come in the winter, and the temperature dips to 70 degrees or lower, the manatees will come swarming into the warming spring water, which stays at a constant 72 degrees.  I have seen over 400 manatees on particularly cool days when temperatures get lower.  There are now (summer) two baby manatees in the springs, who are tagged, for which the staff is caring.  This is a very educational experience with story boards educating visitors along the paths about all creatures, great and small.  The water is crystal clear, enabling visitors to view many types of fish, turtles, while above, on the ground, and in the trees are many types of unusual birds:  egrets, sandhill cranes, storks, and many smaller birds.  There are also many turtles sunning themselves and swimming.  This is a wonderful place for scuba divers, who must register with park rangers.  These divers are interesting to watch as they disappear into the underground rivers which feed into the springs.  There are picnic tables, a gift shop, fast food stand, and clean rest rooms.

You start at the top, and either swim or float on a tube your way down to the exit stairs, then get out and walk back up to the start to do it again. Highly recommend swim shoes since everyone is walking barefoot and then they help once you‚Äôre in the water since there‚Äôs a lot of rocks. Bottom steps were very slippery. If you have younger children, it would be wise to have a float for them and make sure your older kids can swim, especially if they fall off their tube since there is a nice current. No place to put your belongings unless you have a picnic spot or leave it in the car. There was a small gift shop that sold bottles of lemonade or water and prepackaged ice cream treats. Bathrooms were decent and clean. There‚Äôs a boardwalk that runs the length of the river and you can easily see all the huge fish, alligators and turtles in the lower portion of the springs. It‚Äôs definitely worth a trip to see this beautiful place, however, temper your expectations knowing there can some rowdy people that detract from the experience. Overall a good place to see authentic Florida. ",carolynl654,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Detroit,Michigan,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
2/12/2020,"$6.00 to get in per car is reasonable.  The front staff person taking money needed to practice smiling.  I felt sorry for her, she appeared to hate her job.  We said it was our first time there, and she explained nothing except to give us a map.  When we asked where we go she said straight ahead and park your car someplace.  OK, that is what we did.  We got here at 8:15 because I had read the park fills up and they don't let you in.  For first time visitors it is not spelled out what to do. . No signs at the parking lot that say-- go here and walk along the boardwalk to see manatee. .  The Boardwalk s built along the river with little jet outs that allow you close to river to look out and down for Manatee.  We thought it was just one lookout spot until we started asking questions of other guests that were wondering around. We parked initially at the first parking lot on the Right, big restroom and gift shop. But after seeing no Manatee (count at entrance was 177 manatee) we packed up and went to second parking lot.  Second parking lot is much bigger and has parking for about 10 RV's also.  Restroom here also and this affords you the view of the area that the river, flows into the lake. There we saw about 12 manatee. 3 park rangers were there to ask questions and they were very chatty.  They had no explanation of why the count was 177,  but we were only seeing 12.  This is the area where you can take a 2 hr boat trip in the lake.  The water in the spring is definitely clear, but beyond that I felt a bit tricked come here.  There is a hike that leaves the 2nd parking lot and it was not near any water, hardly a bird was seen, and it was mostly out in the sun. I have seen much more manatee in other parts of Florida.  When I asked about why they were not counted in the areas I have been to, the rangers stated unless it is a state park the manatee are not counted.  I won't be back to the park.  But if your goal is clear water, and a few manatee, this is a option for seeing them.  Call the park first, , because the Manatee do come and go in the river.",Cynthia W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Freeland,Michigan,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
2/14/2021,This is a beautiful state park. Took a while to enter because of the traffic but we‚Äôll worth the wait. The Manatees were great to see in from the St. John‚Äôs River. Put this on your stops. ,Dick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Winona,Minnesota,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
1/3/2021,"We were lucky enough to have our own kayaks to bring to this park. I would arrive early as a lot of manatee are in the springs early in the morning. The hiking trails are well maintained and easy. We saw A TON of manatee in the springs when we were there. Then we kayaked in the St. Johns river (kayaks aren't allowed in the spring when the manatee are there), but around 10:30 AM as the day warmed up the manatee started leaving the spring and they would swim around, under and up to your kayak. It is a magical experience. We also kayaked part of the Snake Creek which is wild and beautiful. We saw otters, crocodiles, turtles and a bunch of cool birds. You can definitely spend a whole day at this great state park.",Corey L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Coon Rapids,Minnesota,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
1/8/2020,"Today was our second visit to Blue Spring State Park.  The water from the spring is so clear it is very easy to see the park's main attraction--the manatees.  Winter months are the best opportunity to see them as the ocean water is cold.  The count today was 401.  So many other varieties of wildlife and birds are easy spot within the park.  They have kayaks and canoes to rent.  Last year we rented a canoe and had manatees swim right under us.  Do not try to pet one, it's a fine of about $2500 as I recall.",2BNKD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Minneapolis,Minnesota,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
11/8/2019,"The first of five state parks with springs that we visited.  We spent one night in Cabin 3 which was comfortable and has everything you could need for a short visit except an internet connection for your computers or iPads.  The sofas and beds are not the most comfortable ones we've ever used, but they were okay.  The facilities are great and varied.  You can take a 2 hour cruise on the St John River or rent a canoe for the river or the springs.  The area of the boat launch has a playground, bathrooms and snack bar with plenty of parking.  From there it's a 15 minute walk with viewing areas on the Blue Springs boardwalk that follows the spring run.  At the swimming area the water is crystal clear with steps descending into the water.  Also in this area is a camp store, gift shop, covered picnic table area, bathrooms, and more parking.  After our cruise, we walked up the boardwalk and saw one manatee.  It was still too warm on Nov 1st for there to be many coming into the springs.  At the camp store, we enjoyed delicious BLT sandwiches.  From here it's another 10 minute boardwalk stroll to the spring's boil (source).

Fish were jumping at bugs at surface of water.  And the big show was this 12' very large gator hanging out.  Locals said this is the largest gator they've seen in the wild.

12/12/2019,Wow! What a great visit! Wednesday morning and we got to the park in time for the 10am boat tour. The park is lovely and there is a boardwalk that lines the warm springs - where the manatees father. The views of the manatees slowly gliding by are wonderful. The boat trip cost about $25 (less for seniors) and worth every dollar! Our guide was mellow and very informative- pointing out all the animals as we measured along the St. John way before we spotted them! The ticket booth and the dock are in the park - I called ahead to make sure there were seats since we were driving from Orlando!The weather was drizzling but the boat had a canopy and we were comfortable!We saw many birds- manatees- alligators!,Aeloa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lincoln,Nebraska,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

It was really a nice time watching them swim, moms and babies together. This was one of the highlights of my vacation. And it was only 6 dollars for the both of us.

1/21/2020,"We visited Blue Spring State Park for the second time in two years.  Really great park for all ages.  There is camping sites for tents and/or car/campers with fire pits etc.  Canoeing, Kayaking, nice hiking trails and the best thing- is the Blue Spring itself which comes out of the ground at its source called ‚ÄúThe Boil‚Äù.  It is an upwelling of absolutely pure (72 degrees year round) ground water that puts out over 1 million gallons daily which eventually feeds into the North flowing St. John‚Äôs River.  The Boil itself is a large opening in the bottom of the river which goes down more than 150 feet and continues for an unknown distance underground.  Since 1973 10 divers (many were very experienced) have died trying to find the bottom of this spring.  You can dive there but must have Cave Diver Certification and need to register with the Park Rangers.  In summer, you can bring your inner tube (or rent one) and starting at The Boil, drift downriver for several hundred yards, then get out and hike back to The Boil along a nice wooden boardwalk and jump in again for the next float.  Canoeing and Kayaking allowed up to a point but not to The Boil itself.  There are Huge four to five foot Gar (fish) everywhere you look in the crystal clear water.  Also found there are Channel Catfish, Bowfin, Tilapia, Striped Mullet, Largemouth Bass, Tarpon Longear, Bluegill, Readbreast and Warmouth.  You can see down at least 20 feet in the crystal clear water from observation decks all along the boardwalk which parallels the river.  Oh yes- there are also alligators (not sure how that works with the swimming and tubing in the same river!!!).   Last but not least, in Winter (January & February) since the water is a constant 72 degrees, the Manatees come up river to Blue Spring and hang out to stay warm.  They cannot survive long at less than 66 degrees.  In peak season up to 300 can be seen in Blue Spring.  PS: come early as the park fills to capacity by noon as tourists want to see the Manatees.  We saw three in the first 5 minutes we were there.  There is also a boat tour that leaves the dock at 10:00AM & 1:00 PM.  Great place for kids, families and older folks.  Snack Bar and Gift Shop.  Old Mansion of the original owners of the land were Blue Spring is located is also available for a tour (no charge).

Place was well taken care of, bathrooms were clean,and kayak rental girls were nice, and plenty of picnic tables. We brought our lunch  but there is food available there.  No alcohol allowed.

I think if we had been here between December and February we would have seen hundreds of manatees.  We took the river boat tour and saw a lot of wildlife ... alligators, herons, eagles, egrets.

2/12/2020,"I love this park! We went in late January and I ended up going back a week later at the beginning of February. At that time of the year, the crystal clear waters were filled with manatees staying warm for the winter! Most of them hung out across the river, but occasionally a few would come very close to the observation platforms. The boardwalk is lovely to walk along and very well-maintained. I bought a T-shirt in the gift shop and I saw lots of families enjoying the picnic tables. I also did the short hike to the spring itself and that was very nice too. Even saw an armadillo! I am sure I will be visiting frequently! I am pretty sure there are additional hiking trails that go into the woods of the park, and I saw a bike path that I'd like to try. This time of year, though, it can get crowded. We went one day and the line of cars going into the park was so long, we had to give up and come back the next day. We were also given good advice to go when it's a little cloudy and not windy. The sun glare and the wind ripples make it harder to see the manatees. If you have polarized sunglasses, bring those too as they help to see better into the water. We also enjoyed seeing the many fish and birds that hang out in and around the river. I hope to try swimming and tubing there once the manatees have left. More than worth the $6 entry fee!!

The Rangers are very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. If you stay at the campground you can walk down early in the morning and watch all the manatees before the crowds arrive and the manatees swim out to the river to eat. The Ranger told us she counted 405 manatees the morning we were there. There is a nice short walk down a boardwalk to the boil. We were not allowed to swim while the manatees were present however we rented kayaks and enjoyed all the wildlife the river had to offer.

2/3/2020,"We had been here once before a few years ago and loved it.  We came back with an elderly friend who lives in the area to take the boat ride on the St Johns River.  Here are a few tips:There is one parking lot for the far end of the park along the River where the tour boat docks (which fills up early) and another a bit closer to the park entrance near the spring.  It is a very long walk for anyone with mobility problems to walk from the springs lot to the boat dock.  The boat ride is lovely and the river is beautiful.  We tried to make reservations online and it showed both the 10am and 1pm cruises full but when we called the next morning there was space on both cruises. - so don‚Äôt depend on the website.  Our cruise was eventually filled, so when we boarded we took one of the last empty row of seats for 3 people on the boat which was on the left side.  The boat operator, who is also the guide, sits on the right side in the rear so the entire cruise was conducted for the right side of the boat.  We cruised down the right side of the river and the guide pointed out and stopped at things he saw on the right side of the boat.  People of course got excited when there was a bird, alligator or manatee to see and they jumped up from their seats totally blocking the view of everyone on the left side - so we probably saw about 30% of the guided tour.  I would take the boat ride again but only if I could be at the front of the line to get on so I could take a seat on the right side.",sc457mike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Saint Helena Island,South Carolina,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

Amenities of the park include a campground, cabin rentals, hiking and biking trails, canoe and kayak rentals, swimming, picnicking, and a 2-hr. river cruise.

1/2/2020,"We visited in August 2019. It was a little crowded but we arrived early because of the park capacity limit and didn't want to miss out. The facility is a little old and restrooms and changing areas could be improved and up dated but it is a state park. We did not see any Manatee because it was summer. We got into the spring and swam/snorkeled to the spring boil with tubes rented at the park. We had our own mask and snorkels. The water is slightly cold but crystal clear. There are fish everywhere. NO ALLIGATORS. We were told that the alligators don't visit this area due to the low water temp. The spring boil is amazing. The cave is open and you can actually dive down to the entrance. The water flowing out is quite powerful. There were actual cave divers there going in the spring. They told us they could go in the cave/spring outlet several hundred feet. It was a truly amazing sight.  Everyone at the park was friendly and all the FEEs were low. We rented tubes. They do run out of tubes so get them early. They are rented by the hour. You can bring your own tubes but be aware there are some restrictions. The entrance ramps that you must use to enter the spring get very congested. Some people were not considerate and held up the area. You must enter the spring at one of only two stairways into the water. Many would get to the waters edge at the bottom of the stairs and stop because of the low water temp clogging the area and would not move. Just be patient. It is a little frustrating, the staff just intervene to clear the area but they do not.

3/29/2019,"We ate at the Shrimp House Grill which was excellent, then we rented a pontoon boat at the waters edge and took about a 30 minute boat ride to the Blue Springs State Park.  We just docked the boat on the shore and then entered the park.   There are approximately 600 manatees that winter there because the water temperature is 72 degrees year around.   These are hugh mammals with pups and are so graceful as they swim by.  Since we had never seen a manatee in real life, this was a wonderful treat.  We also saw garr fish and other fish spawning in their little nest.   Just a great day of seeing God's creatures.   They also had plenty of bathrooms.  Since we came in by boat, we heard that if you arrive by car, then get there early as it fills up pretty quick.  You can also rent kayaks and canoe's at the park.  You will definitely enjoy your day there.",David Hoover,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Chattanooga,Tennessee,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
12/18/2019,"The park is just at the edge of Orange, Florida but was amazed to find that there is no sense of being so close to town. Park personnel have done an excellent job of minimizing human infringement on nature. Most of the campsites will only accommodate smaller travel trailers but several are large enough for at least a 34‚Äô trailer. There is no sewer hookup but there is a dump station inside the park. Beautiful views of the St John River and the springs that provide warmth for the manatees that call this area home each winter. The number of manatees vary each day but at least 6 or more can be seen at any given time. These gentle giants share the waters with several species of fish that can be seen in the clear waters. We brought our own kayaks and paddled close to the protected manatee area, being careful not to run over them. Several swam out into the main channel of the river, gliding close enough to the kayak to get an up close and personal look at the magnificent creatures.",Karen M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Emory,Texas,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

10/13/2019,"This was the prettiest place we saw on our trip. The water downstream was so calm and reflective, while the swimming spots were so clear. The holes were beautiful. We had just missed the manatees, which was a bummer. There was also a 7 for alligator we just missed, but at least we could swim, since there were no alligators. The water was beautiful, slightly cold, but fun to snorkel in. Lots of fish to see. Turtles and lizards were everywhere too, which everyone loved. One of the highlights of the trip for me.

8/22/2020,We love the Florida springs and always try to find one close when we are in Florida. While vacationing in St. Augustine our family of 9 had a bioluminescence kayak tour scheduled and decided to make a detour and visit Blue Spring State Park the same day. We had a great time. We had a few tubes that we brought and also rented a few. A few members of our party chose to just walk/swim it without a float. The float didn‚Äôt last as long as I expected... only about 5 minutes. It was no big deal to walk back and float again though. We went midday on a Wednesday and it wasn‚Äôt at all crowded. The water was cold but refreshing. There was a orphaned manatee they were trying to acclimate to the springs. It was so exciting to be able to see this. It was swimming all around us. There was a lady in a kayak following it around to make sure no one harassed it. So exciting... and for $6 a vehicle!!,DrAMac2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Rosedale,Virginia,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
1/1/2020,"My husband and I stayed at Blue Springs State Park during Christmas break.  Beautiful park with nice wooded campsites, very clean bathrooms, and a short walk to the springs (or you can drive).  The best part of my trip was my early morning walk with my dog to the springs to see the manatee without the crowd of day visitors.  Would stay again!  Also went to the Stetson House close by.....my second favorite part of this trip. ",Debbie P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Zuni,Virginia,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews
4/24/2019,"My wife and I visited Blue Spring State Park while staying at Daytona Beach. My wife wanted to see some manatees and many of them winter there. While it was late in the season and most of the manatees have left, we did see two manatees swimming in the crystal clear waters of the spring fed creek. The park is a beautiful place to visit. The entry fee is $6 per car. While there you can, swim, snorkel, kayak, paddle board and canoe. (they rent canoes and kayaks there or you can bring your own.) There is a campground, and lots of picnic tables. We also took a 2 hour river boat tour on the St. John's River that is based in the park. We spent about 3 hours there.

The water is so clear you get a great view of them. The day we visited the state park workers said there were over 600 manatees counted. At the head of the stream you can clearly see the cave opening where water comes out and forms the river. There are also many fish in the water including gar fish. After walking we enjoyed our picnic lunch. Restrooms are available. There is also a gift shop with nice souvenir items. There is also a small canteen which serves food, but we didn't go in there because we had packed a picnic.

We all had a blast floating down the spring and the kids had an amazing time snorketling getting so close to fish they don't see at home!  And they can't guarantee it but the manatees came in and were floating right next to me  an my son that was snorkeling was a little scared and excited when this big grey animal was coming towards him in the water!

3/25/2019,"We had learned about this state park from a friend that grew up in the area.  I am so glad that my daughter and I drove up to spend a couple of hours last week while in Orlando.  The park itself is beautiful and has well maintained trails and boardwalks. We hoped to see manatees, but knew that we might not - and we were not disappointed!  The water is so clear, it was very easy to see them lounging below the water surface.  The popularity of the park was evident by the cars in the parking lots, but the park itself is large and did not seem crowded at all.  Clearly tubing and swimming are very popular and something we would do on a return trip.As an added ""extra"" - we happened to be there on the day when the Sea World rescue team was attempting to assist a sick manatee.  It was so interesting to watch them in action, despite the manatee outsmarting them!",Jessica0823,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Stevens Point,Wisconsin,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

1/19/2020,"This is one of the most beautiful places we have been to.  We saw @ 14 manatee in blue green clear water from the spring.  There is a boardwalk that you can walk the entire length of the spring before it goes into the St; John River.  We took the 2 hour boat tour and saw 2 bald eagles, osprey, alligators, turtles, and lots of different birds and plants along with a manatee that came right up to the dock.  We also rented a kayak and went into a bay area and a manatee came right up to us.  There is a $2500 fine for touching one, so even though we could have petted it we didn't.  We stayed in one of the cabins which has a gas fireplace, air conditioning, bathroom, and everything you need except soap and shampoo.  When we got there, several of the windows were unlocked and someone banged 3 times on the back of the cabin that night which makes me wonder about the security at the park.  Some of the wands are gone from the blinds and we had to twist them by hand and kept the blinds closed at all times.  Black mosquitoes were coming up from the bathroom drain and we had to keep a damp wash cloth over it.  There is no stopper for the bathtub and the screen was cut or ripped on the porch.  There is a hook lock for the screened porch and a twist dead bolt and chain lock for the door.  Be sure to take repellant because the mosquitoes will eat you alive on the boardwalk.  The Thursby house on the property is open for self tours Wed.-Sun. and is very interesting with exhibits on life in the 1800's.  There is a camp store and two places to buy sandwiches, ice cream, etc. and a gift shop.  There is a trail, but only walk to the end of the forest because the rest of the trail is in sand and hot open scrub brush.",blackriverwoman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,West Virginia,West Virginia,United States,Blue Spring State Parktripadvisorreviews

This place has lot of reviews so don't know what I can say that is different.We did eat lunch there.  Prices weren't too bad.  Now I do think that they overcharge for their sweatshirts ($44),  T shirts were twenty five to twenty nine.  Did find one for twenty.  Maybe it was on clearance.

4/6/2019,"We stayed in the camp site of the park April 2-6 and was able to walk to the river every day. We saw manatees every morning, but normally not after 12pm. The best time to go that time of year would be between 9-11. The kayak and canoe rentals are inexpensive and a great experience. You do not have to take a guided tour. You can also rent tubes to 'Lazy river' down the river, which I highly recommend, or even take your own floating device.The walkways around the river and to the spring are beautiful and peaceful. Just be warned that although the park is pet friendly, pets are not allowed close to the water. My kids enjoyed swimming in the clear water.

1/22/2021,My wife and I recently visited Blue Springs park to see the manatees for something to do outside during COVID times  recently on a Tuesday late morning.  It was a brisk January morning but not freezing.  We didn't expect the size of the crowd there for a Tuesday but the one lot was already full (no big del - we parked in the other end of the boardwalk).  The sign stated that there was 454 manatees in the park the day that we visited. We saw at least 100 of them strolling the 1/4 mile boardwalk and lookouts.  The sun is on the other side of the water so they were for the most part in the shallow waters in the sun so not real close to the boardwalk / lookouts but could still see the loveable sea cows.  It was an enjoyable and non-hurried morning strolling the waterside and gazing them and the huge amount of fish and some birds.  It was very pretty and definitely Old Florida.The only negative was that some of the people refused to war their face coverings (during COVID - approximately 25% of the people) and did not social distance.  We were not in a rush so we just moved away from them.  We sat an open park like area  deciding where to have lunch in Deland and enjoyed the scenery.  There were kids running around and playing in this park area.  A pretty value priced day ($6 per car) to take the family to get of the house.,Rhino2525,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Daytona Beach,Florida,United States,Blue Springs Parktripadvisorreviews

At first we thought ""wow, we're close to our neighbors"", but everyone was respectful, and it ended up feeling like we were camping with friends by the time our trip was over.  We camped at site #12. The spring is beautiful and there's a 1/4 mile spring run where you can kayak or tube in totally clear water until it hits the Sante Fe where the water turns brown (due to the cypress trees).  The only drawback was that the bathroom/showers are shared with the day visitors, but since they left at 7:45 p.m., we just used the facilities the most in the evenings.  The bathrooms are cleaned every morning between 7 - 8 a.m.  Overall, we give our experience two thumbs up!

They have covered pavilions, not sure if they are first come first serve or reserved as well as a few scattered picnic tables. There is a small beach area to the entrance into the ‚Äòpool‚Äô area of the spring. The parking lot was fairly small and all sand. The driveway in is also all sand. The mile hike is a path full of tree roots and the like so not great for those with difficulty in walking and definitely not good for a wheelchair.

8/5/2020,We've visited a lot of Florida State Parks and in terms of natural beauty this on is not to be missed! The spring is amazing and that kayaking/canoeing on the Santa Fe River is definitely worth it.We camped here for one night and that was plenty. This park is on the smaller/less developed than most others I've seen so there really isn't much hiking or anything to do besides swim in the spring. It was worth it to camp because you basically have the spring to yourself in the evening.The facilities were below par compared to most state parks. The entrance road is long and super rough. The campground is very small and not very private. The bathhouse looks like it was built in the '50s and not updated (or deep cleaned) since. It's my understanding that this had been a private attraction and the state only acquired it a few years ago.

I also looked at the showers and they were dirty at 11 am. Hubby said no toilet paper in men‚Äôs stalls. Men‚Äôs restroom was nasty as well. I noticed there is no sewer at the campsites so you will need to use showers and toilets. They also had no dump station. The sites were very small and could not accommodate a big camper.

Sites are close together with no privacy but walking distance to the bath house and spring was very close. Great fun and the water always 72 degrees for a hot day swim. They do have rentals of kayaks and water boards. Would recommend for family for easy access to the spring and has a small beach area.

4/30/2019,"I have spent the better part of the last hour reading reviews of this park.  I am currently staying here in my 19 ft. travel trailer being pulled by an older model Chevy truck. We have not experienced any of the problems as observed by some of the disgruntled ‚Äúcampers‚Äù in their posts. Yes, there is a sandy dirt road entrance, yes, the road back to the camping area is a little rutted, yes, you can see other campers from your site.  What‚Äôs the big deal?  It‚Äôs called camping for a reason, if you want luxury accommodations go to a 5 star hotel.  I don‚Äôt know what some people expect when they go camping in Florida at a natural spring in a state park, but I highly suspect these individuals cannot be pleased. So I say to them, PLEASE don‚Äôt come back, save this natural wonder for those of us that truly respect what nature has to offer.  The natural beauty and absolute wonder of this place far outweighs the inconvenience of anything that we experienced. Ok, rant over. The springs are absolutely beautiful, the trails leading to the swimming area and campground are pristine and easily accessible, the rangers very helpful and informative, the kayaks , canoes and paddle boards in great condition.

1/8/2020,"We chose this park based on the description that you could get up to a 7 mile walk in one direction. Starting off, it was difficult to figure out exactly which path to choose from the parking lot to get started. We knew we wanted the yellow blazed trail, but there were NO yellow blazes. Fortunately we chose the path to the furthest left and a ways out came across a yellow blaze. But about 1/2 mile out, the path started to get rather muddy and stayed that way for over 1/2 mile. Finally, after Cedar Creek Bridge the path dried out and widened out. It was very nice after that. But we were already about 1 1/4 miles out and knew that we would have to return back through the swampy section.

We hiked the Bulow Woods trail, which I referred to as ""the jungle"". Along the trail we found a lot of different wildlife including deer, spiders, snakes, grasshoppers and toads. We also found many areas that were tore up by hogs, and hog tracks. I did end up with many mosquito bites, even with wearing insect repellent, so be aware of that.

There are signs on the walk that inform the visitor how the process of  sugar was made from sugar cane and shipped out by creek to the river.  There was also a building that exhibited many artifacts from that period found on the grounds. Walking through the park or driving one can see where the plantation house was built.

From there you drive a to the ferry parking lot and then you have to pay $14 per person (round trip) to get onto Caladesi. I think it's $6 for kids over 5 and free for those under 5. The ferry leaves every half hour and only takes about 15 minutes from dock to dock. The staff is fun and they even teach you a little on the ride. We love going to Caladesi because it's so quiet and clean. I've never seen it really busy and you never have someone right up on you like you get with other beaches. There is a 4 hour time limit though which I feel is enough. They have a gift shop with well priced sundries. You can also get smoothies, beer, burgers and such. I've been told that the food is actually really good although I haven't had it myself. There's plenty of bathrooms, showers and even some beach carts for the handicapped. It may not be the best for small children as they tend to have a ton of belongings that won't fit well on the ferry if it's crowded but it's great for adults who want to lay out and relax or go shelling/surf fishing.

4/30/2019,"I've heard the stories about the canals in the mass of mangroves that leads into the central part of the island. The canals are so narrow that it's sometimes difficult to row given all the mangrove roots. The path eventually opens up to the marina with a worker there to assist in securing kayaks. Admission is cheap $2 with easy access to the beach, nature trails and other amenities. The food was good though less than reasonable but having access to hot food on an island is worth the extra cost. The beach is beautiful and less crowded given the less than convenient island location but I enjoy those little gems you have to work to get to.",CharlesOwen84,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Brooksville,Florida,United States,Caladesi Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

The fee to enter Honeymoon Island is $8.00 and the ferry is an additional $14.00.  The ferry runs every 30 minutes, and you are encouraged, but not forced, to return after 4 hours.

We loved that it was somewhat remote and secluded from tons of people on the beach but we expected it to be that white powdery sand and quite frankly there were a lot of rocks, tons of seaweed, and shells.  The water was also not crystal clear like I would have expected.  The only reason it's not that popular there is because it costs so much to get there.  $14/person for the ferry and an additional $8 entry.  I hate to be the tough critic here, but I wouldn't go back.  Clearwater Beach was much better beach conditions (other than being overcrowded).

There is also a large shelter house for picnics.  We found a location to plant our umbrella for the four-hour stay.  There was time for shelling, watching stingrays, and swimming.

4/4/2019,"I chose Caladesi because I can't stand crowded and built up beaches. We went to Honeymoon Island (which is also very nice) and took a 15 minute ferry ride to Caladesi. You have to pay to get into the state park and for the ferry - but it was worth it. On the island we had 4 hours. There is a beautiful nature trail. If you exit at the beach exits you will have a much quieter beach than if you go right by the visitor center area. Still neither are anything like Clearwater in terms of crowds. The sand is lovely! We also paid extra to take kayaks into the mangrove tunnel. It is actually a tunnel with mangroves all around and above you - loved it! There are many small crabs so if this bothers you, you may not like it. Check the tides carefully because if it's too low you can't go and if it's too high you also can't go. We got lucky with hitting a perfect time to go through the tunnels. The people in the visitor center will be able to help you time it out. But, check the tide schedule before you ferry over or call for the best time before spending money on the ferry if kayaking the mangroves is high on your list. You can kayak the tunnel in as little as an hour. We all though the money to go to Caladesi was well worth it and recommend this island to anyone who enjoys places that are not commercial. There is a place to buy food and drinks on the island.",avsbe7,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apple Valley,Minnesota,United States,Caladesi Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

7/22/2019,Caladesi island is a beautiful place. Our family loved the ferry ride over and decided to rent two kayaks to go through the mangroves. It was hard and long but memorable. Here is where I had the problem...we were told by Annette ( keep this name in mind) at the cafe when renting where to return the kayaks when finished. We followed Annette's instructions and returned the kayaks where they should be. We decide to go the beach before boarding the 3pm departing ferry. As we were getting to leave the dock ..Annette ran towards the docks pointing at me ( I had no clue) very abruptly! She in her harsh tone asked me where the kayaks were ( they were returned as I said earlier) She then told the ferry driver that we may have to wait till the next ferry ride ( absolutely rude) . I explained to Annette in a calm voice that the kayaks were returned. But obviously Annette had it set in her mind that we had them under our beach bag. I informed Annette that two more people came in to rent kayaks after we returned. Maybe her paperwork skills were not up to par. The reason I'm writing this is to make you aware that Annette is not very good at customer service and honestly was completely out of line making accusations. I spoke with manager and he said he would handle it. Besides Annette it was a great day so please don't judge Caladesi island on Annette's poor personal skills.

3/17/2021,"We (party of 2) arrived to honeymoon island to catch the ferry at 1230. Maybe our downfall was arriving at this time. We waited in line to buy a ferry ticket for 45 minutes. When we reached the front, we were told it would be another 40-50 minutes until our ferry as previous ones were full. There we were also told we had a scheduled return time of 7pm. We might be able to return earlier if there was room. I'm not sure if this is a new Covid instruction, but it's definitely not my vibe. We had dinner plans at 6pm, but decided to risk it anyways.We did not get to the island until 3pm. 2.5 hours later. The island itself is beautiful.

6/12/2019,"This is one of those places you must go to and spend the day there.  Unfortunately, you have to take a ferry to get there that is not cheap especially for a family with children.   You can take your beach chair and a cooler with you on board the ferry.  The water is turquoise blue and the sand is white and powder soft.  The only drawback to going here is that they do not advertise anywhere that the last ferry leaves Caladesi at 4:30 so if you don't go early in the morning, you have wasted your money.  This is not the kind of place you can go to for a late afternoon swim or to just relax after work.  They do not have a sign posted anywhere that tells you the last ferry is at 4:30 and you only find out after you have bought your ferry tickets.  The ride over is very short; about 20 mins; and on the way you may see dolphins and manatees.  It's a really enjoyable day if planned right.

The captain stopped the boat to allow is to see some playful dolphins. Had an enjoyable 4 hour respite on this secluded little slice of heaven. My teens were a little disappointed in that there weren't many waves...and yes this beach is relatively calm so leave the boogie boards in the car as a raft or float would be more appropriate.

We went on a Monday thinking there would not be many people.  It was surprisingly busy!  Long but skinny beach at high tide so you may have to walk some distance on the beach to get to a dry spot to set up camp.  Bathrooms and food available.

The rainbow cottages are locked up, empty and not rentable. The lodge that the whole area was built around is unfurnished and locked up. It really looks like where the movie Dirty Dancing was filmed only its deserted. It says less than a mile round trip to beach however, by time hubby and i walked down a gravel road and over a small bridge past the bad part if the park and came out into the opening we could see the ocean, wayyyyy on the other side of ALOT of beach.  It was hot. VERY hot. And that was a long walk knowing we had to walk it back and would be itchy and sweating and did I mention how hot it was> LOL So we turned around and did not go to the beach. Get there early. ( before it gets hot) Know that you have a walk ahead of you and the sand is very deep. Not for small wheeled items and remember that they may say 1/2 mile but that was the longest looking half mile i have ever seen. Maybe I am just burned out on climbing up and down deep sand dunes in 100 degrees  to get to more sand that I cant find a dot of shade in. I would have walked it in a heartbeat if it had been winter or early spring but then you cant swim.

Once we got into the park, we took the BEAUTIFUL walk to the beach-it was hot and it was .7 of a mile I think (did seem longer). But it was so worth it! We were there pretty early in the morning and we literally had the whole beach to ourselves. As far as the eye could see either direction-no one. We spent at least 2-3 hours there. We found some pretty shells and had some luck finding beautiful sand dollars there as well. We try and visit state/national parks where ever we go.

When you get to the dock you'll walk just a minute or two until you get to the beach.  Take a LEFT and start walking - and I mean WALKING about a mile down the beach - away from everyone else.  We found amazing shells and sand dollars.  Up your game by getting a scooper and a bag.  It was chilly the day we went (60's, but I am from Arizona so anything less than about 75 is cold to me!) but the water was actually warmer than on Sanibel.

When you arrive at the marina the Captains make it easy for you to load gear on the boat, Captain Blue really went above and beyond as far as entertaining and capturing the interest of the children on board. After about 45 minutes on the boat you arrive at the Island, its very well organized and everyone tends to help one another out with unloading the gear. They have wagons to help bring your gear up to the trolley that will take you back to the camp sites and cabins. once you setup camp take some time to explore the beaches, there are shells everywhere and the water is nice and cool, sunsets are quite beautiful and make for good pictures. The island has a lot to explore, my son and I left on a Friday and stayed until Sunday which came a lot quicker than we expected. Definitely made some memories that neither of us will forget.

She was also the tram driver and was very helpful - a true joy.   The lady who was in charge of NOT renting kayaks - not so much.  We walked in and before we could finish our inquiry she raised her voice and practically yelled at us that she wasn't renting out 'her kayaks' on a day like that - adding that one would have to be crazy to think about kayaking that day.   Yes, there had been some rain in the early morning but the skies were then clear and it actually turned into the most beautiful day ever - but just her anger was a bit over the top.  It was obvious that - for whatever reason - she did not want to be bothered with checking the weather or renting out kayaks.  Fortunately, the weather was absolutely beautiful, the beach was pristine, calm and quiet.

4/16/2019,"Perhaps I should have known, because I've lived in Florida for 12 years and all, but I just wasn't prepared for how extremely buggy this island is in April! Holy cow!We booked a primitive site online a few weeks out (only got a Friday night because it was booked up almost through the rest of summer for weekends). After the arduous journey by boat (by arduous I mean unloading all of your camping gear from your car, loading it onto the boat, unloading it off the boat, loading it onto the tram that takes you to your campsite, unloading it off the tram, and then walking it to said campsite) we were pleasantly surprised to find that the ranger was going to let us stay an additional night in one of the few non-reservable walk up camp sites. (Very friendly rangers!). The day on the island was great, we spent it walking up and down the long stretches of beach (and didn't see a soul for miles), swimming in the Gulf, and fixing up our camp site. This beach is insanely gorgeous and scenic; there aren't many places in the US where you can go and be so far removed from life and other people, it's very pleasant and relaxing.Then came sundown. The NOSEEUMS started their 18 hour bloodbath on us and didn't give up until late morning the next day. Yes, of course we had bugspray. Did it help at all? Absolutely not. Thinking our tent was going to be a place of solace for us, we were disturbed to find that our tent mesh was not small enough to keep the noseeums out. Yep- we literally had no place to go on the whole island that would allow us a 5 second break of being swarmed by noseeums. When you're living this, it honestly feels like you're in a horror movie. We ended up relocating our tent onto the beach in hopes that some wind would help keep them at bay. You guessed it- Nope. We walked about 4 miles up and down the beach in the middle of the night just to keep moving and keep them off of us. To sleep, we had to fully cover ourselves with blankets. Let's just say, it was probably the worst night of our lives. So that being said, here are some tips.TIPS-Visit this exquisite island, but not during buggy season -Get a tent with very small mesh that will not let noseeums in (or better yet, reserve one of their cabins)-Perhaps bring a fan with you to keep bugs off if you do go in buggy season-If possible- bring your own boat for a camping excursion, it'll be much less cumbersome-Bring cash or check with you- to buy firewood or an extra night of camping, it's cash only.

3/19/2019,"Paddled to Cayo Costa for 3 nights of camping. It is a very beautiful place to visit, and camp. But I do have a complaint about it. You have to buy your wood at the camp store, it is $10.00 for 4 smallish pieces of wood. My favorite thing about camping, at 62 yrs. young, is the campfire. Their wood would burn for about 25 or 30 minutes, kinda expensive to have a 3 or 4 hour campfire each night...Their rules prevent a camper from burning either Palm Fronds, or driftwood. They encourage (their rule) to leave everything that's on the ground, on the ground. So, with that being said, you will encounter massive amounts of No-See'ems there. They appear at sunrise, and an hour prior to sunset. ",Bob A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Punta Gorda,Florida,United States,Cayo Costa State Parktripadvisorreviews

4/2/2019,I read reviews about the island and after camping for 2 nights I have to say base nothing on the negative reviews. Yes the boat was late but the staff explained why and it is basically a shuttle service so don‚Äôt base anything on the boat.We got to the island late but the staff stayed late and kept the store open so we could get wood and ice and shuttle us to the campground. I am not sure about the cabins they were older and set back from the beach with little breeze.  The campground sites were huge and many had shade and sun. The ones near the shuttle drop seemed to be the best. Just be aware that you can only rent bikes from 9-4 so if you want to bike later bring your own and there is a lot of sand so wide tires are a must. Wood is expensive but it burns slow so a bag is good for an evening campfire.  The store has a few essentials. There is bottled water but 2 bucks. There is potable water at campground. There is ice cream candy.and other souvenirs and a few other snacks and easy to prepare camp food so you won‚Äôt go hungry and they take credit cards. ,denisechandler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hancock,Maine,United States,Cayo Costa State Parktripadvisorreviews

They built a new bath house (cold water only) and demolishing the old which is unfortunate. The campground does not have a bathroom. The cabins have all 3  Even the end camp sites have a bit of a walk. The new one is in front of cabin 2 if you want to look on a map. Ok for men..because they will urinate at the campsite..girls...too far. If you have to go,now add a flight of stairs in the dark!  If you are in a wheelchair..The ramp will seem like miles to the top.Noseeums are abundant and miserable if you dont take precautions. Will get through the mesh so you need to spray the mesh on your tent.Bring MANY cans of bug spray.Minimum 40% DEET  Picaridin or Permethrin..which is needed for ticks.The family sand flies aka nosseums are in.You cannot be uncovered for a second so spray after swimming and showering. I wore the .88 mosquito bands at Wal-Mart on each limb. At night I slept in a bug jacket/pants found on Wal-Mart's site for $18. They sell at camp store,too.I walked off that island after 3 nights with a single bite on my shoulder in the worst month..April.

Well, actually, it's just one very long beach about 9 miles long with lots of turns and coves and wraps around the end.

12/11/2020,"Off the beaten path just outside of Marco Island is Collier-Seminole State Park.  It was almost November, out of the normal rainy period for Florida, yet the park was soaked.  Our site was water logged, and I had to use 4-wheel drive just to get our Airstream into it.  I would imagine summer is worse with the daily rains.The park itself is nice, with the usual Florida park amenities like hiking trails and a nice canoe/kayak launch (although we did not kayak, the paddling trails looked awesome).  Our site had a gravel base, although not all sites did.  There are sites big enough for class A rigs.  The bathrooms are very clean.  The staff, like in most Florida State Parks, were very friendly and helpful.  The mosquitoes and deer flies were really bad.  The Bay City walking dredge‚Äî used to build Tamiami trail‚Äî is a marvel of 100-year-old engineering. The Blockhouse was closed during our visit.Two things to note.  There is no TV reception or WiFi, and cell reception is slim to none.  So if you‚Äôre wanting a break from mother nature, forget it.  Bring a book or a puzzle.The good news is that you‚Äôre not far from Marco Island for some culture, or far from Everglades City for some non-culture, Old Florida style.My advice is to come during the winter months, when the temperatures are cooler and the bugs aren‚Äôt as bad.

No biggie to us!)  and the building was well lit at night.  The campground layout is very open and we had a great breeze coming through, which was nice considering it was Oct. in Florida.  Only negative about the place was the mosquitoes/no-see-ems.  Don't forget your bug spray or you'll literally be carried off by them!!

We were able to book last minute, and while we were able to secure spots, we did have to move our campsite twice due to available (not complaining - we were happy to get spaces and knew in advance).  Our thoughts:1.  Easy get away from Miami, FL.  2.  Tent camping spots are tight in, but you don't feel over crowded.  If you are more of a remote nature purist, this isn't for you.  3.  Bathrooms were VERY clean and well supplied.  Water was hot for showers.  4.  Felt safe in the tent area.5.  Road noise was an issue on the outside camp site, especially when the motorcycles come down the highway.6.  Lots of kids ages 8 - 13.  Fortunately, our group made friends with other kids and they had a blast.  7.  It was fairly cool and windy the week we were there, so we had no issue with mosquitos. 8.  Rangers, staff, volunteers over the top friendly and helpful...High kudos!9.  Canoing was nice.  We did not do the tours because of the age restrictions but would have done the moonlight tour if we could.10.  Geocaching....we love to geocache, so it was a great way to get the kids on the trails to hike.12.  We are not RV campers, but they really pack in those RVs.  I felt a bit claustophopic on that side.13.  Would be nice if they offered recycling options in addition to trash.14.  Park was clean and well maintained.15.

It was 99¬∞ Saturday and Sunday (in the shade) and we got some relief Monday with a drop to 98¬∞ Our poor a/c running 24/7 could only bring the temperature down to 81¬∞ inside the camper during the day but very comfortable after sunset (and there is nothing wrong with our a/c so don‚Äôt even think it). Our friends suffered the same, but were smarter then us and left a day early. On a positive note there were no mosquitos which I‚Äôm sure all died of heatstroke or sizzled like bacon to death! I managed to find relief from the suffocating heat by going to the meticulously kept bathhouse and showering for 40 minutes every day. We‚Äôve been camping for 34 years in Florida and never experienced this type of heat, has to be global warming! I‚Äôve never been so badly burnt by the sun (near 3rd degree burns, cataracts, and kidney failure from dehydration was imminent) An ice cream truck came Monday, I thought I died and went to heaven when I saw it, or at the very least I was hallucinating.

There is a stairway up to the top of the main mound, but the view of the river from there isn‚Äôt anything special, there is a massive tree blocking a good portion of the view.Each mound has a simple story board explaining what its purpose probably was. The visitor center is big for a small park, with some archaeological artefacts from the site, and pictorial representations of what it is thought the place was used for.

6/5/2019,"I've been wanting to bike this loop for several years now and finally had a travel companion willing to ride it with me. First we had to have a tired repaired on the only adjustable speed bike my parents had. The other bike was a 'one speed of me' beach type cruiser.The 7 Mile Loop Trail lists the time to complete as 3-5 hours which confused us as we were riding bikes, but we deduced the time was for walking. So off we rode.  The trail quickly heads west into Pine flatwoods and as it heads north you peddle your way through the brackish marshlands. As the trail begins to turn more easterly, you find yourself riding among the freshwater marsh and then turning south, heading back towards the trailhead you cruise under a canopy of hardwood trees.The terrain is predominantly flat but is sandy with grass areas and lower areas are muddy - but the trail is well maintained.There are benches placed along to trail to rest but I wouldn't recommend sitting idle too long. We had a terrible time with the deer flies when we stopped to get a quick drink of water and even while we rode through certain areas the deer fly attacked us. Their bite is not friendly!The 7 Mile Loop tooks us 'amature bicyclists' 70 minutes to complete. And that was moving at a good clip for us 50+ year olds who are in fairly decent physical shape!The sign at the trail head warns about mosquitos and ticks, but I would not recommend walking in the warmer weather due to the deer flies. And I suspect the low areas would hold water with a heavy rainfall.All in all - wear long sleeve shirts, bring water and enjoy the ride!",Holly S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Cincinnati,Ohio,United States,Crystal River Preserve State Parktripadvisorreviews

2/13/2020,"The Florida seaside parks are extremely difficult to get camping spots at. We lucked out and got a walk-up spot we were able to renew daily for a week. The RV spots are parklike, landscaped, groomed and semi-private. RV's are 30 to 40 feet apart. This is very unusual for parking on the beach. The shower house is spotlessly clean and modern. The kayaking is awesome with a combination of narrow mangrove canopies, open lagoons, shallow sand bars and shallow calm ocean cruising. The oceanside beach is protected by the offshore reef. You can kayak to one of the nearby offshore sandbars at low tide for sand sharks, rays and shells as well as great swimming. kayaks can be rented at the park office. There was a nice sea breeze and a mature and friendly crowd in the campground. The public access area is just as nice with two sun shelters and clean restrooms. This is a favorite spot for kite boarders and they provide a lot of entertainment. There are occasional nature lectures and live music on the beach.

We had to go out of the park entrance and drive a half mile or so to a parking lot along US 1/Overseas Highway to get to the trailhead. The path is mostly flat with a lot of tree roots to watch out for, as well as the poisonous trees (described on a trail marker sign; touching the bark can cause a reaction like poison ivy). You come out of the woods on the Gulf side, and then return along a loop trail. Towards the end as you are heading back towards the trailhead, we thought we stayed on the path, but we apparently went on a detour and came out of the woods right by our car (the trailhead was another 0.1 mile away). I saw a sign that warned of ""Venomous Snakes"".

5/9/2019,"Curry Hammock has a small to medium sized sandy beach, wedged between a small bay and a campground. It has toilets and I think showers, and a few picnic tables under wooden roof structures on cement slabs, so it's certainly conducive to a get together. The beach is north facing and seagrass bordered, which means there is some debris with wind or tide changes. It seems to be a beach for wind/kite surfers. There's a few rocky areas to the left that are fun for scouting hermit crabs and snails when the tide goes down. The south side of the highway has the walking/biking paths and is less clearly marked. There's a small parking area on the north side of the highway. The path is blacktop and looks well-maintained, and I could easily imagine riding a bike down it, but I think you'd have to bring the bike in from elsewhere.

1/4/2020,"For over twenty years the Dade Battlefield Society has been commemorating the most widespread armed conflict in history and celebrating both military and popular civilian culture during the WWII war years. Every year, this event grows. This weekend included Allied and Axis uniformed re-enactors, authentic camps and equipment, and 1940‚Äôs military vehicles. You can take part in intelligence gathering and other missions, enjoy USO-Style music and watch the comedy team performing as George Burns and Gracie Allen. What‚Äôs nice is that each site has a representation of authentic memorabilia during WWII with living history re-enactors available to answer your questions. You become fully immersed when they regale you with their stories. They portray the units of the military and civilians from different backgrounds, German, and American. One such German Re-enactor was Aldis Grauds who portrayed Bruno Almanis who was the Unit Commander for the First SS Panzer Battalion.Book Author, Elin T. Gottschalk experienced WWII when she was a child and documented her story in her award winning book ‚ÄúInto Exile: A Life Story of War and Peace.‚Äù  Four months before her mother passed away, Author Cynthia Sandor found her mother's secret journal from the time she was in the League of German Girls and wrote her mother‚Äôs biography entitled ‚ÄúThrough Innocent Eyes ‚Äì The Chosen Girls of the Hitler Youth.‚Äù  Set under the canopy of the oak trees, military vendors display their authentic pieces and food vendors will fill your belly. Stroll along the hiking trails with their abundant wildlife, stop by the visitor‚Äôs center and view the WWII displays. The bathrooms are clean! The event opens up to the public at 10:00 am and be sure to participate in the raising of the colors at the Gazebo. By 11:00 am, the entertainment begins with a USO style Armed Forces Radio Broadcast at the Alligator Pavilion. Make sure to put your dancing shoes on! By noon and again at 2:00 pm, troops and vehicles pass in review around the park. Closing ceremony is held on Sunday at 4:00 pm. It takes a dedicated group of people to plan, organize and host this annual event. Special thanks to Steve Resnick, President of the Dade Battlefield Society, the First Florida Chapter MVPA, and the Florida Historical Preservation Society for putting this annual event together.  Thank you for your service!",Cynthia S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Tampa,Florida,United States,Dade Battlefield Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews

4/21/2019,"This site tells of a battle between two distinct cultures.  This site tells the story from both sides points of view, which makes the site unique.  There is a small museum and film , a trail, and a small recreation of the last stand fortification.  There are also picnic areas and a learning center for events o‚Äôplenty.  Here the victors win but reignite a conflict that will kill most of its warriors and deliver most of its citizenry to Western lands.  The losers will win the war eventually, but at the costs of hundreds of lives and millions of dollars.  Here you will hear of strategy gone awry - ‚Äúthe soldiers built a pen and then got into it.  Knowing only the Great Spirit could command them to do such a thing, we attacked again‚Äù.  You will hear of careful planning for a tactical victory that will result in strategic defeat.

Very peaceful and there is a roadway for some of the trail. There are markers on some of the foliage and because the direction we first took didn't find out until about 2/3 of the way in that it was a failed house development. You can still see some of the street walls that were left and there is a small flower garden pretty soon after you enter. Take bug spray and a hat.

11/18/2019,I chose to walk the long loop with my dog.  The long loop was flooded above my knees at some points.  There were no signs indicating when high tide would be.  There were no signs indicating how much of the trail would be underwater.  Since everything was under water you couldn't figure where the trail was even if you wanted to continue walking through the water.  It felt eerie and lonely and abandoned.  I was very surprised to see how much plastic washes up to and stays in the mangroves.  I will definitely try to lower my plastic usage in the future.  The park could even use this devastation to educate patrons on plastic recycling.  This was not a relaxing walk and I would not recommend this park.  The state needs to figure out what this parks purpose is and build on that.

The volunteer at the entrance was incredible and knew everything about this piece of land and it‚Äôs history. We learned that if developers would have built the housing they planned, the Florida reef system (3rd largest in the world) would have been decimated.

3/10/2020,This park was created in the 60's when a developer failed to build his development. He started the infrastructure so there are some old paved roads that are now used as trails. We really enjoyed the trails through the natural areas although mosquitoes became evident pretty quickly so take repellent. There was a volunteer from the nearby Pennecamp State Park who was available to answer questions and he was quite informative. There is a restroom available at the entrance to the park and laminated maps which can be borrowed. I would recommend taking a map or taking a picture of one because the trails are not very well marked.

It is a road with 5 parking lots with short boardwalks over to the beach.  The water at this time (late June) was crystal clear and beautiful.  People just lazing on beach, in shade and floating in water.  Some fisherman down by the pass.  Not an unruly crowd.  Very clean.  Good bird life and butterflies and native fauna in the woods.  Not a lot else to do here but go to the beach... but what a beach!!!!  It is $6 per car for entrance.

11/1/2019,"We tried to go to another beach area the night before and it took so long to find a place to park that we missed the sunset.  The following night, we tried Delnor-Wiggins Pass and it was a breeze.  It cost us $6 to enter, but it was worth it.   We parked 10-steps from the walk over and the water was another 20-steps from the end of the walk-over.  The beach was clean and beautiful.While the park was a high recommendation, I will warn that when someone tells you the Red Tide is coming in, prepare for a rough beach visit.  Our hotel had mentioned this when we checked in, but didn't really know what that meant.  I started coughing as soon as I got out of the car.  I thought I had swallowed wrong.  By the time we made the short walk to the beach, I felt like my nose and throat were tingling and the coughing continued.  We noticed that others were doing the same thing and then realized that this was the result of the Red Tide.  We stayed for about an hour to watch the sunset, but not sure we could have suffered through much more.  I can't imagine how bad this is when the Red Tide actually arrives.",Lotz2CnDo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,West Palm Beach,Florida,United States,Delnor Wiggins Pass State Parktripadvisorreviews

10/17/2019,"Delnor-Wiggins is located in North Naples at Immokalee Road and..the Gulf of Mexico! :-)  West of 41 Immokalee is referred to as 111th Avenue in the Naples Park area.  Note:  if you're not local, you have to pay to park.  Just a few years ago places existed to park and visit the beach in this area, but they're gone.  You have to pay a fee, or have a beach parking pass to avoid paying.  But parking is plentiful and the beach is beautiful.  Being a state park means no alcohol is allowed on the beach.  Just fyi.1.5 miles south of Delnor Wiggins is the Ritz Carlton, Gumbo Limbo and other local establishments, along with a parking garage that provides parking for beach access.  It fills up quickly in season.  The difference between Delnor Wiggins and this area south?  Delnor doesn't allow alcohol and doesn't have a lot of commercial activity (e.g. restaurants, beach bar areas, vendors) and is therefore more ""sedate"" in nature.  Much more activity and ""human infrastructure"" to the south.  Choose wisely.",tac89611,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Naples,Florida,United States,Delnor Wiggins Pass State Parktripadvisorreviews

10/21/2019,"We had to kill some time while waiting for friends in Gainesville and spent 30 or so minutes at Devil's Millhopper Park. I'd suggest longer if you have the time, but we were able to walk down into the giant sinkhole and enjoy some relaxing time listening to the water trickling down from above. It is a lot of steps, so make sure you pace yourself as necessary.It costs $4 per vehicle to visit the park. I suggest having exact change ready, as it is a self-serve box at the beginning of the parking area. There is a station with helpful rangers and an informational display that portrays the geology of the area and the formation of the sinkhole. There are also bathrooms. We did not walk it, but a nature trail goes around the top of the sinkhole. I saw several visitors with dogs. I highly recommend a visit.",FDinger,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Florida City,Florida,United States,Devils Millhopper Geological State Parktripadvisorreviews
10/10/2019,"I found this place by searching for interesting places to stop on the way to Orlando. We often travel and drive straight to our destination without seeing some of the interesting things that Florida has to offer.  I planned this stop without telling my husband, kids, and parents, exactly what it was. When we arrived they were a little nervous because it was a wooded area. Once we made our way to the information boards they settled down and we proceeded to the sink hole. It was absolutely beautiful. There are lots of small waterfalls that feed into the sinkhole and they plants are vibrant. The stairs are not a problem going down, but if you are out of shape like some that were in the group, they are not impossible but a little challenging. We did not have as much time as we would have liked to spend in the park but it was still great. There is a trail that you can take to make it around and lots of signage to tell what the plants and trees are.

9/9/2019,"A fun am hike to start the day! Definitely start as early as you can as it gets hot during the late morning/afternoon. There is a $4 fee per vehicle so bring some cash. The hike down the stairs was a breeze and actually only 132 steps. I was told it was hike back up, but it wasn‚Äôt that bad. There were a few locals doing their workouts going up and down the stairs, one lady did it 7 times. The water was pretty high at the sinkhole, but it was still pretty cool to see. Did the short walk to the left since the bridge is not accessible during the construction. The walk to the right was really nice, easy to follow around the sink hole and to the other side of the bridge. Def keep moving otherwise the mosquitoes will eat you up. Like the website says, you don‚Äôt hear the humans, but the rushing of a small waterfall, birds, trees moving and the quietness of nature. It‚Äôs so crazy to have this in Gainesville when it can easily be mistaken for a more of a foresty/mountain side hike. The only thing I would say I didn‚Äôt experience is the stark change in temperature at the bottom by the sink hole. Maybe it may have been the time of year or the time of day, but it was actually hotter down there than it was up at the top when there was a slight breeze. That didn‚Äôt change how I felt about this area, it was a hidden local gem and I can‚Äôt wait to check it out again after the bridge is fixed and in cooler weather!",J M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Orlando,Florida,United States,Devils Millhopper Geological State Parktripadvisorreviews

12/8/2019,"Some attractions, I dunno, The Grand Canyon? Now THERE'S a geological formation that is indeed mind-blowing!  Others are more subtle, and require some time to pause, look and listen -- it's all about the details.  For me, the Devil's Millhopper into the latter category, and there is nothing bad about that. [Full disclosure: I live about one mile from the Millhopper, and drive past the entrance several times a day.]You can read about the Millhopper State Park by a simple Google search, so I'll let the Florida Parks people tell you the detalis.  Suffice to say that is a 120-foot deep sinkhole, accessible by sturdy stairs. As you descend, you pass through several climate zones, ending in a tropical rain forest.  Along the way, there are waterfalls, springs, exotic -- and native -- plants, some critters (if you're lucky), and just a fascinating look, for me at least, into a bit of ""old Florida -- far from the theme parks.  Anyway, there places you can stop and sit on benches along the way, ideal for just relaxing and enjoying the natural surroundings.  There is also a short hiking trail, and many locals come almost daily to run and stair-climb in the great outdoors, instead of their local fitness center.  It's not an enormous place -- as other reviewers have noted.  Rather, I'd call it ""compact"" and focused.  But take time to take in the subtle details, and relax.  It's worth your rime.  Note: I gave it a ""4"", because the pace and tempo of this place may not appeal to everyone, though I like it.  And the history, geology and artifacts of the place, from the time when Florida was submerged under the ocean, through the times of the Native Americans who frequented the place, seeing it as sacred, make for an enjoyable, educational experience.",stevekirn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Gainesville,Georgia,United States,Devils Millhopper Geological State Parktripadvisorreviews

1/26/2020,Devil's Millhopper was a place I visited (was not a park then) when I was a teenager over 50 years ago. To protect this site from erosion it was made a State Geological Site. After having a set of stairs that was flooded they have built a new safer set of stairs.Unfortunately it does not quite go to the bottom as the last stairs but they are better built and will last longer. This is a pristine place with all the water running into the sinkhole with numerous little waterfalls creating a very relaxing sound. Many ferns and other species grow here that are not normally seen in North Florida. The bottom of the sink 120 feet deep is cooler than at the top. Also there are numerous small caves that you can see.This is a great place for a short visit. There is also a short trail that surrounds the sinkhole but you can't go around all the way because of a bridge that needs repair.

There were dozens of starfish and bottom dwelling jellyfish throughout the canal which led into a peaceful and secluded lagoon. There were lots more jellyfish out there.

It was incredibly peaceful with the sounds of traffic and daily hustle and bustle eliminated.  It is certainly an important park to preserve.  There was a guided cell phone tour and the flow of the farm trail was well laid out.  The highlight was running into Keith, another volunteer working the little store.

We took home lots of goodies (grits, corn meal, soap, jelly) and learned there is a benefit event in Dec with lots of other vendors coming to support the farm.

The house along with the grounds and gardens are the main attraction of the park. There is a heritage rose garden, butterfly garden, hidden garden and a reflection pond. You can take a tour of the house or do what we did and just walk around and enjoy the beautiful grounds. We relaxed while sitting on the benches located down by the Bayou. There are also picnic tables as well as a stage located there. Overall we had a very good experience. A good way to spend the day away from the beach. Other amenities you will find at the park: 1-If you want to fish, Eden Gardens is located on Tucker Bayou off the southeast corner of the Choctawhatchee Bay. Saltwater fishing is allowed on the dock2-If you want to have a picnic, there are tables scattered throughout the park. Additionally there are also four covered pavilions.

5/22/2019,"We have been touring various gardens and state parks throughout Florida, and were excited to check out these gardens and plantation house on our recent trip to the panhandle. We paid the $4 for parking at the front gate, and found plenty of shaded parking nearby. The garden grounds are very small and can be seen in about 15 minutes of casual walking. There was not much of anything to see around the house, and we kept getting attacked and painfully bitten by aggressive yellow flies the entire time. While walking through the grounds, we could see everyone else was swatting at the air too, so the yellow flies were extremely pervasive.We passed the time on the rocking chairs on the porch, waiting for the next tour time to see the house. Unfortunately, we used up all of our cash on parking, and the guide said she couldn‚Äôt take credit card payments so we would be unable to tour the house. This cash requirement for the house tour was not mentioned anywhere on the website, and we were very disappointed that we couldn‚Äôt tour the beautiful house. We asked about ATMs, but were told there were none in close proximity. As the tour starts by the gift shop, I have a hard time believing they have no way to accept credit cards, but we didn‚Äôt argue, and hastily walked back to our car in a futile attempt to escape the biting insects.At least we got to see the beautiful exterior of the house, so it wasn‚Äôt a completely wasted visit, but overall, we were quite disappointed by the meager ‚Äúgardens‚Äù and our inability to tour the house.",Jeremy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Orlando,Florida,United States,Eden Gardens State Parktripadvisorreviews

8/7/2019,"This southern estate turned state park is great.  It costs $4 per vehicle to get in.  It's on the honor system, but park rangers on golf carts make the rounds.  They can see if you have the paid sticker on your dashboard.There are three different ways to enjoy the park.  Picnicking, water access activities and walking the grounds around the mansion.Picnicking: After you self-pay, you can pull into a parking lot or turn left down a road to two picnic areas.  There are trails that you can walk through the trees.  It's perfect for bird watching in the early morning.Water Access: Near the picnic pavilions, there is water access to put your own kayak into the bayou.  I did not see rentals, so I assume it's for people who already own theirs.  There are a couple of docks with shore access to view the lagoon.Mansion: In the main parking lot, there is an obvious walking path that curves around the gardens and ends at the mansion.  It's a short beautiful walk with manicured lawns, Spanish moss covered trees, and the mansion itself.  It's picturesque.I spent about two hours here.  I slowly walked the short trails looking at birds.  I sat on a bench looking over the bayou and read a book.  I watched tiny fish swim around the dock and along the retaining wall.  It's was peaceful solitude that I thoroughly enjoyed.

However the map seems to suggest a lollipop shape so I specifically asked the park ranger about it and was told the same thing - she said ""This walk is 12 miles in total, it is NOT a loop and at mile 6 you have to turn round and go back the way you came"". I walked the whole trail last week and can tell you that this is totally incorrect. Just before the four mile mark a wide trail goes off to the right, this is your return route making the complete walk slightly less than ten miles. The photo I have posted shows the position on the return leg, just after the six mile marker. So the map is very clear but the written details are totally wrong. I have no idea why park staff and the information board give the wrong details which could put people off doing the trail. To be honest, there isn't much to see on the trail but it's a pleasant enough way to spend a few hours.

Very crowded swimming area but plenty of space to take a cool dip.Boat ride was neat and worth the price.Wonderful place for families that want to slow down and smell the roses for a day or two ( no t.vs) but WiFi is available.,Rosewoodfoodie,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Cedar Key,Florida,United States,Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

6/4/2019,"What a great place to visit on a hot holiday weekend when most of nearby Tallahassee is closed.  Had lunch at the lodge which was delicious and served in a timely manner for us to catch our boat tour - which was the absolute highlight of the trip.  Had such a good time.  22 gators, 9 manatees, turtles galore, birds with nests right next to the boat (they've certainly acclimated to tour boats).  After that we took a hike on one of the trails, cooled off by dipping our feet in the 69 degree spring water at the swimming area, and then back to the lodge to enjoy a cold beer in the lobby.  What a pleasant state park filled with all kinds of opportunities for a nice day out in nature.",mookiethecat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Tallahassee,Florida,United States,Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews
5/8/2019,"The hotel is run by a private company within the park. We had made our overnight reservation long in advance; however, we were not told that they had booked a wedding for the same day which restricted our access to most of the building. Initially we were told that we could not use the only elevator; however, that was corrected when we pointed out the several of us a handicaps that would prevent us from climbing stairs. In order to get to the restaurant we had to walk outside and around the building to a side entrance. The restaurant is good we ate breakfast and dinner. The spring is very nice, water is cold at 72 degrees. We took the boat ride and highly recommend it.

Ethan is very knowledgeable about all the wildlife, trees and plants. Before our boat tour my husband had a hotdog, chips and coke at the snack bar - which was very good and reasonably priced. The lady who works there was very pleasant. Additionally, we happened to sit down close to the gentleman that handles the maintenance for The Lodge. He also was very nice and shared some interesting history about The Lodge and the park. Overall we had a wonderful time! Don‚Äôt miss this wonderful park!

9/13/2019,"I spent about 4 hours visiting the park. I took the boat tour twice (back to back) so much I enjoyed the ride. Not expensive at all for an hour tour. Steven (or Stephen) and Jeff conducted the boat tour and both were great. The Lodge is beautiful and I had a nice lunch at the snack bar. If you want to see alligators or birds..this is a great spot. In addition to gators I saw: Anhinga's, Comorant's, White Ibis, Little Blue Heron, Great Egrets, Glebe's, Moorhens and others. Clean restrooms, swimming area, hiking trails (though I didn't hike since it was like 99 degrees).

7/28/2019,"The line to get in on Saturday was about a half mile long...all the way to the highway. Luckily we got there earlier in the day but what about those that were staying at the lodge? We were going to swim there but the crowd was nasty people smoking everywhere although the rules posted stated ""no smoking"" . There didn't seem to be anyone in charge except the lifeguard on the dive tower. If this is a state park now...maybe a ranger should enforce things? I'm sure there was alcohol in unmarked cups too....otherwise, there would be beer cans littering the river as we saw in the surrounding rivers and springs. Also if this is a state park now, shouldn't the people be allowed to enjoy the place, with respect of course, via kayaking etc? I suppose that the money being made from the tour boats is too much to forego for that to happen. For paddling in this area, I recommend the Wacissa or the lower part of the Wakulla but neither on a hot weekend day. The rivers then are filled with disrespectful thoughtless young trash that are only concerned with getting drunk , and being a nuisance to others.",ski,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Newnan,Georgia,United States,Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

Lots of picnic tables with three pavilion covered picnic areas. The boats rides are well worth the money and just as good as Silver Springs (if not better). Plenty of gators,, fish and maby a few manatees to see. The old hotel lodge is small but comfortable. Plenty for all to do! $6 entry fee for a car load of eight.

7/2/2019,This is a very interesting place. The spring produces 200-300 million gallons of water every day and becomes the Wakulla river. The history is especially interesting. There is a large swimming area and also a river boat ride. Very reasonable prices. We saw beautiful scenery from the riverboat and many alligators of various sizes. Also many beautiful birds. There is a lodge and a restaurant. We are planning to return and stay at the lodge. Definitely worth seeing this beautiful place if you are in the area.,Tony S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Rome,Georgia,United States,Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews
6/29/2019,"We stayed for a day in Wakulla springs lodge to cover Wakulla Springs boat ride, take a swim and explore some trails. The $8 per person boat ride is absolutely amazing, the boat ride lasts for about 45 minutes, we might have spent several hundreds of dollars for this trip and about 36 hours of time in total... but this 45 minute experience seemed to justify all of that. For our family the swim in cold waters (69 degree temp water) did not cut it.. We tried the main trail and covered Sally ward and Hammock Spur trails, Sally ward and back to lodge should have been sufficient for the experience, we did not enjoy Hammock Spur trail, it was about 3 times the length of Sally ward route and there was not much to see. One thing was sure, even by late afternoon no one seemed to have ventured into these trails as we had to clear lot of spider webs along the way.A tip: if you have couple of extra hours, its a pretty good idea to make a trip to St. Marks National Animal Refuge.",ATLTennis1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Alpharetta,Georgia,United States,Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

8/27/2019,The park offers activities and has a lodge on the premises.  There is a $6 fee per car but this is credited to a boat ride or meal in the hotel.  There is a designated swimming spot although I don't know if the alligators know if this is off limits to them!  While I might not be brave enough there were lots of people braving the cool water.  It was a peaceful spot and we enjoyed having lunch in their historic lodge which overlooks the main spring.,travlingmama,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Chicago,Illinois,United States,Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

The food was well prepared and our server was very sweet and attentive.  We were disappointed that the boats were not running due to Covid, but will certainly return again to this historical place for a boat ride.  The number of people allowed in the swimming area was being limited, also due to Covid ,but because this was during the week it was not a problem at all.

3/10/2020,"This park is spectacular.  There are lots of walking trails, but the centerpiece of the park is the lodge and boat ride on the river.  When you park in the lot, you can walk to the lodge and check out its history.  There is also a restaurant and old fashioned soda fountain store.  There are beautiful flora and fauna, and the park is well taken care of.  You can pay extra for a boat ride that leaves at regular intervals.  I suggest that as soon as you get to the park, you sign up for boat, as it fills up quickly.The boat ride is led by a park ranger, and we had Kat for our tour.  We saw tons of alligators (even little babies), birds, turtles, and snakes.  It is rich in diversity of wildlife; a feast for birders and nature lovers.  Kids of all ages will love it!!

This park has a lot of amenities, a hotel with a restaurant, a beach with fresh spring water that was always around 68 degrees year round. TONS of wildlife (please see my pics!) Lots of picnic tables, pavilions, trails etc. You can easily spend a half day to a full day and never be bored. This park also has a lot of history with an alligator legend and everything.

The river was COLD, even in the heat of late August. I would not plan to get in the water unless it's a hot day. We hiked the Hammock Spur Trail to the river, which was nice, short, and not overly hot in the summer heat.  Our biggest disappointment was we did not get any good photographs of the clear water. When we drove in the sun was directly overhead and you could see the bottom of the river, when we came back out the sun was lower in the sky and the river looked like any other.

12/4/2019,"Wakulla Spring SP, home to one of the world's largest and deepest freshwater springs, is a 6,000 acre area teeming with wildlife.  One of the main attractions here is the riverboat ride.  Our singer/songwriter/park ranger/ guide punctuated our hour+ long ride around the springs with songs about the animals in the park.  At the boat dock, the  first birds one encounters are the hundreds of Black Vultures who, apparently, like to follow turkey vultures around because that bird has a better sense of smell for carrion than they do.  So they use the turkey vultures and then drive them away.  This is just one piece of info that you will learn. We saw many Ibis, herons, egrets, etc along the way.  Several alligators were seen despite the cool morning temperatures,  including one mama who had a front paw bitten off by another alligator. I guess they are not above eating their own kind. One of the main reasons people go on the boat ride is to see the manatees - and see them we did.  One tip is to wear polaroid sun glasses to see the animals in the water better.Near the end of our boat ride we saw two manatees very close, partly above the surface of the water.  That was thrilling.  They were actually partially in the roped off area where people are allowed to swim.  After the boat ride we walked thru the Lodge built in 1937 - there is a lunch bar and a gift shop here. Then we walked a nice trail thru the Florida flora.There is an admission charge to enter the park and a separate fee for the boat ride. Open 365 day a year. Pets on leashes are permitted.

The park ranger was knowledgeable and showed us the wildlife along the river. A young boy that was passenger on the boat counted the manatees and alligators and said we saw 48 alligators and 15 manatees. The old bald Cypress trees had Spanish moss hanging from them. It was a beautiful boat ride. We were able to see old Joe Jr, the 13 foot alligator. We then went to the gift shop where they had a large selection of items to purchase with good prices. Which I did. In the lodge we saw the stuffed old Joe Sr and heard his story from a volunteer. Then we ate lunch in the lodge at the restaurant. They were busy but we got our food quickly.  I ate the captains chicken and my sister had the bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with crab meat. They were both delicious. There is a  counter in the gift shop where you can get ice cream and hamburgers, etc.  The lodge is lovely and even if you're not staying in the lodge you should go look at the painted ceilings and old time pictures.This state park is a hidden gem and I would highly recommend a visit.

3/18/2021,"A completely different kind of State Park! We took the last ferry trip of the day (afternoon) and there was hardly anyone else on the island in the middle of the week in March. It's easy to bring a cooler and a chair and an umbrella if that's what you're looking for. We had a great time wandering along the old brick roads, exploring the concrete foundations and batteries, and speculating about living out there on the island.We saw LOADS of gopher tortoises, osprey, and a bald eagle. Didn't see any snakes or racoons or anything scary (except wasps, we did see a few, but not many). There are precious few places to sit - we found a couples different sets of stairs that were in the shade that worked for us.Use the restroom before you go on your trip-no facilities! And bring a cooler or lunchbox. Seriously, there's nothing out there, not even drinking water! We took a full lunch, snacks, and 4 large water bottles. We had too much food and drank 3 waters in 4 hours.It was delightful to be out there, knowing how far away from land we were, and really not being able to hear civilization other than a few boats and the occasional helicopter. The beach was easy walking. We were there at high tide, so there weren't a ton of treasures to be found, but we did come home with some nice smaller shells.You should go! If you like being outside and non-commercial beaches, you'll enjoy it!We took the Egmont Key Ferry operated by Hubbards Marina, it was $30/person.

4/3/2019,"Took the Ft. DeSoto ferry over! Nice beaches, interesting history of the island, and lots of tortoises all over the place. Kids thought the place was really neat. It was our 2nd time to the island. There is too much ground to cover everything with just one trip as you only get about 3 hours on the island by taking the ferry. Best advice....go when the water is calm! It's not nearly as nice when the waves are rough. Saw some fish snorkeling up near the ruins on the west side of the island, but that was the only place.",lilguy46,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Saginaw,Michigan,United States,Egmont Key State Parktripadvisorreviews
2/5/2020,Our family of 4 loved our time spent here! Our tickets were $25 per adult and $12.50 per kid for the ferry ride to get there and back. We booked it online. The captain and Tony were great! Very friendly and informative and gave the kids a shark tooth they had found! The waves were rough because of high winds but our 8 year old son loved it! We boarded the ferry at 11am and got back to the same spot by 2:05 pm. Re-boarded the ferry from the key at 1:45pm to go back.  Wish we could‚Äôve stayed on the island longer but we had a lot of fun in the time allotted. Saw 2 dolphins briefly on the way to the key! Sooo many shells everywhere! At 1st we found small conch type shells that had parts broken but the further we headed the better shape those shells were! Lots of big shells too! The old buildings/rubble were neat to see and also the lighthouse. We saw 2 tortoises! Loved going here with my family!,Melissa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Piqua,Ohio,United States,Egmont Key State Parktripadvisorreviews

We were a couple of hours early for the ferry so we went swimming and hung out on the pier watching the local fisherman.  It was hot but the water was cool and gorgeous.  We rode the ferry over to Egmont Key and was over there a couple hours.  If you want intact shells that is the place to go. We found so many gorgeous intact shells and intact sand dollars.

Although it‚Äôs rather small, there‚Äôs so much to look at and is very unique to any other park. There is acres of wildlife parks and beautiful views.

All the birds and animals appear very happy and well cared for (all are injured or unable to be reintroduced to the wild).

5/25/2019,"I cannot write highly enough of this park. I had always wanted to see manatees but didn‚Äôt think I would be fortunate enough. However, no only did I see them, but I did so in this beautiful gem of a place. All the volunteers do amazing work and this is reflected in this place. It is peaceful, beautiful, elegant and so calm. It costs only $13 each to get in and is open from 9 - 5 with parking freely available at no extra charge. There are lots of wildlife here - Lu the hippopotamus, a bobcat, a bear and numerous other animals and birds. All are clearly extremely well looked after and every habitat we saw was pristine and the animals looked very well cared for. The manatees are just ..... breathtaking. To see them gently glide along in that water which defies description is awe inspiring. There is a viewpoint below the water where you can see them close up if they come to you - we were so lucky, arriving just around feeding time so they were around but we were also lucky enough to see them at various parts around the shallows. The talks are educational, interesting and really informative and help you understand more about the creatures you see. The walk around this place is just idyllic. It was really quiet when we came, and it was stunning. There is a carriage to take you when you arrive to the other end of the park, and you can either get it back, or walk or, as we did, get the boat back so transportation is well thought through. None of this costs any extra, and it definitely adds to the experience. Each takes just over 5 minutes and the boat is so tranquil it is really relaxing. There are restrooms which are clean and well appointed and there is a small gift shop  with some really nice things in. There are beautiful views and things to see at every turn and if you love nature then you will be hard pushed to go anywhere better than here. Go, see for yourself and help to keep this wonderful place caring for the animals.

The manatees were a particular highlight, with an interesting talk as the volunteer fed them lettuce.

Such beautiful, HUGE animals. The underwater observatory is really neat, and air conditioned, which was a great little break from the heat. The pathways are shaded , so even on a hot day it was not terrible. You will need to take some water with you.

We saw several alligators, a couple of big ""cats"", and a few manatee, although the wild ones weren't much in residence the day we were there.  The park experts expected more of them due to the inclement weather, but for reasons known only to them, they didn't show themselves that day.

We were there when he was celebrating his (her?) 60th b-day.  How fun.  The park is easily navigated on boardwalks so no worries about long hikes.

1/2/2021,"This is a great little walking park with close up photo ops of native birds & wildlife however my daughter & I did not feel safe at all. For a government facility/National Park Service, this was not in compliance with Covid regulations. Even through the website said there was a mask policy in place, it was not evident or enforced. The park rangers at the cashier booths although behind a sheet of plexiglass (nothing on the side towards the people in line) did not wear masks when I came in or hour & half later when we left. Large groups of people jammed in while waiting to buy tickets (many unmasked & nothing mentioned). The ranger did tell people not purchasing tickets could wait outside however no one was social distant even after many of them left. Three old ladies sitting by the bathrooms and many more loitering inside the building were not masked. Most people (3/4) outside were not masked and not practicing social distancing. It was crowded, especially on the walkways. It was oftentimes hard to duck around unmasked people, especially as most people did not act aware that we were in the middle of a global pandemic. The indoor exhibits were closed, which is fine and understandable. We totally skipped some outdoor exhibits like the deer & manatee viewing because there were so many different groups of unmasked people crammed together. People in the gift shop not masked even though they have masks for sale by the register.

1/24/2020,"Took out 4-year-old grandson to the park.  It was the first time for all of us.  It's a little over an hour north of the Tampa area where we live.  We got in for free as we have the Florida State Park pass and he is under 5. We liked walking the boardwalks throughout the park and seeing the different birds and animals.  We were surprised to only see 3 manatees, which were in the tank--none in the river/spring area, but that's not controllable.  There are many birds such as hawks, owls, flamingos, eagles; a reptile house, and my grandson loved seeing the black bear.  We also enjoyed the underwater viewing area, where we saw many, many snook and other fish in the spring.  The spring water was pretty.  We took the boat ride from the main entrance off US19 to the west side of the park where everything is.  Grandson wanted to ride the tram back but it wasn't running continuously as were told (more like a 20-minute wait between rides), so we ended up walking back on a blacktop road the tram uses to get back to the parking area.  We saw turtles on the boat ride and the captain narrated--nothing that special, but if you've never seen Florida before it's interesting to see how nature looks here.  Expect to pay top dollar in the gift shop, but I figure the money goes towards the park's upkeep I assume so that's okay.  We had to buy a tote bag though as they don't put your purchase in any kind bag.  It was fun to see once but don't think we will return.

1/20/2020,"A very beautiful place to visit, located on HWY 19 4150 South Suncoast Blvd. Homosassa, Florida The park is officially named Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park in honor of Elmyra Felburn Schiller (1943 ‚Äì 2009), a benefactor of the Florida state park system. The park is about 75 miles north of Tampa & 90 miles northwest of Orlando.HERE IS A LITTLE HISTORY ABOUT HOMOSASSA SPRINGS!!!Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State park has been a tourist attraction since the early 1900s, when trains stopped to let passengers off to walk the short trail to the first-magnitude spring. The tracks ran alongside what is now Fishbowl Drive. While passengers enjoyed a view of Homosassa Spring and its myriad of fresh and saltwater fish, the train's crew were busy loading their freight of fish, crabs, cedar and spring water aboard the Mullet Train.The 50-acre site and surrounding 100 acres was purchased in the 1940s and was operated as a small attraction. In 1964, the Norris Development Company bought the property and expanded it as Homosassa Springs ""Nature's Own Attraction,"" with an emphasis on entertainment and with a variety of exotic animals and some native species. Ivan Tors Animal Actors housed their trained animals at Homosassa Springs Attraction for several years. These animals were trained for television shows and movies. When they were not performing they were kept at Homosassa Springs.  One of the most popular of these animals was Buck who was a stand-in for Gentle Ben in the famous television series. Lu, a hippopotamus, was one of the Ivan Tors animals and still resides at the park after being declared an honorary citizen of the State of Florida by then Governor Lawton Chiles. Norris owned the attraction until 1978.From 1978 until 1984, the land went through several changes in ownership. The Citrus County Commission purchased the attraction to protect it as an environmentally sensitive area until the State of Florida could purchase the property as a Florida State Park. Modern thinking about captive wildlife has influenced how the park is now managed. Both visitor safety and animal welfare are of utmost importance at Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park.With Florida's Wildlife in mind you will -Discover the wild-side of Florida with endangered Florida panther, red wolves, manatees and whooping cranes, plus black bears, bobcats and of course, alligators.One of the most interesting encounters is a floating observatory, where you descend into a wall of glass encloser where you can view hundreds of Fish and Florida's Endangered Manatees, this natural springs water is a very comfortable year around temperature of 72 degrees and can be observed at close range 365 days a year.There are many wildlife to see on the walking trails. From - Alligator's, Back Bears, Florida Panther, Hippo & of course Manatees.Here is a footnote on Lu the Hippo - Lu is the oldest hippopotamus in North America, and the only animal in the park not native to Florida. Lu was born at the San Diego Zoo in 1960. He appeared in the TV shows Daktari and Cowboy in Africa and he has lived in the park since 1964. Lu's Birthday is 26 January.Along the trails, you will also find resting places, picnic tables & bathrooms...Homosassa Springs Wildlife - also offers, Educational Programs on Manatees, and Florida's Wildlife.Children's Education Center, offers variety of hands-on activities, & Boat Tours...Homosassa Springs is a quiet, relaxing, beautiful place to enjoy a full day of fun and learning experiences all rolled into one for the whole family, friends & visitors from other parts of the World...People in wheel-chairs,scooters & even new moms with baby strollers, will not have any problem  getting around inside the park as it offers paved trails & boardwalks.For parking - plenty, also for Handicap!!!Park Hours are - every day from   9:00 AM - 5:30 PMThe ticket counter closes at 4:00 p.m. All schedules are subject to change, weather permitting...Park Prices - Adults (age 13+) $13, Children (ages 6-12) $5, Children 5 and under, free...Please note: Florida Temperatures are Warm & Sunny during the day and cool at night in the Winter Months .In the Summer Months Florida is Very Hot, Steamy & Humid all day & night.Drink Plenty of Water and a wear a Hat or Visor while you visiting Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park!No Smoking, No Swimming, & Do Not Feed the Animals, Park Rules....This is worth your time to adventure out and enjoy mother nature;s gift.Hope to see you there,  Till later, Be-Safe,  Happy Traveling!!John & Jackie Scalise/Homosassa, Florida",John S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Homosassa,Florida,United States,Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Parktripadvisorreviews

You learn so much about the history and wildlife of the area before even stepping foot into the park - The spring was beautiful, crystal clear water populated with so many fish and manatee - it was breath taking - going into the underwater observatory is an absolute must. You can get 360 views of the spring to see a close up of all the manatee and fish species and on a hot day it feels so good down below. Never seen so many snook and mangrove snapper before! Other than fish and manatee there are so many other wildlife habitats to see at the park - it's also home to the oldest hippo in captivity, and man he's such a character - stick around for the manatee program (11:30) , hippo program (12:30) and the wildlife encounter (2:30). So educational and fun - they feed the manatee and hippo and it's so cool to see Small indoor cafe serving the usual sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs and refreshments. So many cool things to see you can easily spend all day here - $13 per person, $5 for children and kids under 5 are FREE!

The animals all looked healthy and happy. My only negative was once you walked past the electric fences you got sapped multiple times until you left the area. Nothing crazy but my husband and teenage son that it was fun to keep zapping me, younger kids may get scared.",Nickmo06,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Port St. Lucie,Florida,United States,Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Parktripadvisorreviews
10/26/2019,I have been going to the park for many years. My last visit was July 2018 and it was quite different than today. Some of the animal cages with signs had nothing in the cage. The property is starting to look shabby and is in need of sprucing up. The underwater fishbowl needs attention;  you can't see through the glass any longer. I missed the reptile house. They moved the Manatees to a small pit. They are no longer in that large area. I don't know if I will be back.,Marie N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,New Port Richey,Florida,United States,Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Parktripadvisorreviews

10/3/2019,"First there are two places to park, our GPS took us to Fishbowl Drive but we decided to stay on 19 and go there instead. When it is not busy and you do not wish to take the slow boat to ‚ÄúChina‚Äù aka to the park, then drive straight there using Fishbowl Drive. There are two parking lots b/c when it is extremely busy, the Fishbowl Dr parking lot fills quickly. If you have never been before the boat ride over is quite nice to see old FL. We took the boat over and the tram back. Strollers and wheelchairs will stroll along the paths perfectly well. It is a nice walk around to see everything: Underwater Observatory, Garden of the Springs, observe manatee off the dock (in the wild), stroll and see the hippo, deer, alligators, otters, bobcats, FL panther, reptiles, shore birds, red wolves, etc. I was very impressed with how well they were being fed, their habitat, and seeing Florida‚Äôs ‚Äòwildlife‚Äô up close and personal. Restrooms are available, picnic tables, concession areas, and educational programs too. $13 for adults but so worth it. Very nice outing for the day. Saw a couple manatee out in the wild off the dock which I was surprised this early in the season. We saw a baby and what might have been, the baby‚Äôs mom. The baby still was in perfect shape but the other very large manatee had its tail cut by a boat. We stool and watched them come up for a breath of air for quite a bit of time. Loved our time there.",FLGIRL,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The Villages,Florida,United States,Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Parktripadvisorreviews
10/3/2019,"The park is remarkable with lots of wildlife to see besides the manatee's.    Deer, gators, bear, panther, many many birds and flamgios, a reptile house featuring all of Florida's venomous snakes and more.   Manatee show/feeding was very nicely done and informative about Manatee life.  Inside the park was great.   The park employees who took our money and admitted us were borderline rude.    No smiles, no welcome to the park, just take your money and Cya..   Maybe those two were just having a bad day - the other rangers were polite and very nice.

The rangers were all Very pleasant and informative, we missed the last boat ride (our poor time management) but was very happy with spending a few hours walking around the concrete trails and checking out the animals. Lots of cover from all the trees and the smaller pavilions along the trail which served us shelter from a rain storm while we were there too, it's Florida and the storms can happen at any time unexpectedly.

We took a leisurely walk around the park. It was a warm day, but the paths are shaded. We enjoyed seeing the three resident manatees being fed their lettuce after hearing a talk on manatees. They present a number of programs during the day. One of the most interesting was the feeding of the hippo, Lu. Right at three o‚Äôclock he came out of the water and went to his feeding stop.

We were able to get some great pictures of them and learn a lot of new things at the Ranger presentation. The underwater observatory was pretty neat. The fact that this is a place where abandoned or injured animals are taken in to be cared for is really cool. It's different from your typical zoo attraction. We saw lots of different animals and spent most of our day there checking it all out. Our kids are 7, 5 & 2 and seemed to enjoy it as much as we did. the boat ride was fun but the tram back from the park might be a better choice. In the morning it was still cool enough but the afternoon boat ride back was in the direct sun a lot and it got really hot and uncomfortable.

The birds were a hoot - those in the cages as well as the visiting birds who were everywhere. The turtles kept us entertained for awhile, but we are probably not your average folks!

There are accessible restrooms and you can get your chair right up to the boat so if you can transfer at all you should be able to go on the boat ride. and children in wheelchairs could be lifted in.  We spent a lot of time on the boardwalk wildlife trail for all sorts of birds, reptiles, panther, fox - all sorts of native animals.  We learned a great deal from the manatee show   The underwater observatory in the main spring was very interesting and they have a screen on the deck for those who cannot go down the stairs to observe.   But the highlight was their aged hippo , 59 yrs old  - not exactly a Florida native animal but he gets great care.  My son-in-law mimicked  one of his sounds and he did it again and they repeated this several times then he made a different sound and my son-in-law coped him and then did several rounds then my son-in-law moved to different location round his compound and Mr.Hippo followed!

We took the tram into the park after getting our tickets, but there is also a lovely boat ride you can take to get to the park entrance. My daughters (7 and 4) were fascinated by the manatee feeding demonstration, and the underwater viewing platform. The manatees get quite close, eating their heads of lettuce! There are also many, many more animals, nearly all native to Florida, that you can see while perusing the boardwalk and paths. We enjoyed the bald eagles, alligators, gorgeous tropical birds, and the aging old hippo - though he was not willing to come out of the water during the feeding time, due to his old age and arthritis. My child's hat blew off next to the great owls, and a kind animal caretaker went in to fetch it for us. Very friendly staff and volunteers, all chatty and helpful.

There are a variety of animals native to Florida including alligators, manatees, otters, bears, some big cats, and lots of birds including pelicans and Bald Eagles.  There's also an honorary Florida citizen...a hippopotamus.  There's a 20 minute ride on a boat down the Homosassa River that includes lots of facts about the park, which used to be privately owned before being taken on as a State Park.  The boat drops you off at the main area (from the ticket and parking area).  The park is fairly accessible (my dad doesn't get around too good anymore) but there are a few attractions that have some steps involved, including the underwater observation area.

4/21/2019,"Our family went to Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park on a Wednesday at the recommendation of our family member who lives near St. Pete's.  We took our 11 year old boys who had never been to Florida before and their grandparents and we all loved it!  It was a little tricky to find but eventually we found the west entrance and it was easy to park and walk right across the street to the entrance.  Parking was free.  When you first go in there is a little cafe and the gift shop.  We decided to eat first as it was lunch time and we were pleasantly surprised by the choices and the quality of the food.  We had sandwiches, wraps, burgers and salads and it was all delicious and not very expensive.  We went into the Park after that and the cost of admission is so reasonable.  Once you get in there you do a lot of walking but there is a lot to see.  Keep in mind that this is a place where a lot of the animals are being cared for and rehabilitated so you won't always see every animal.  We went straight to the manatees as that is what we were most excited to see and we were not disappointed!  There were 3 manatees swimming in a little cove and you could sit and watch all day if you wanted.  They had a little dock area with underwater viewing that was cool.  You could watch them eat lettuce.  They were such peaceful creatures!!  It was not very crowded when we went but I could see it being a bit much if it was since the areas to view the manatees underwater are not very big but we really enjoyed it.  They have a hippo that is really old who has been through a lot and now gets to enjoy the tranquility of the park.  They have lots of alligators, some that you can see have been injured and are there as more of a sanctuary.  They have a reptile house and lots of birds from eagles to flamingos.  They have a panther and a bear.  Our boys really enjoyed walking along the  nature trail and seeing all of the wonderful things to see!!",dxbabe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Ann Arbor,Michigan,United States,Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Parktripadvisorreviews
2/7/2020,"My friend and I were on our way to Crystal Springs so she could show me the manatees. We were not exactly sure where we were going! We passed this place, and the GIGANTIC manatee statue caught my eye. The big sign behind it said  OPEN, then, when I looked back, I saw a boat filled with people! All right, turn around right now!!Turned out it is a State Park, formerly a privately owned roadside attraction zoo.  Now, it is a rescue zoo and permanent residence for birds and animals that could not be rehabilitated to return to their natural habitat.We all boarded the ferry like boat that took us down the river to the start of the walking path. A very informative gentleman piloted the craft and pointed out several areas and points of interest. He gave us tips for the rest of our walking tour as well. We also rode the boat back when we were done, but there was a tram like option as well.There is a ""snake house"" that totally creeped me out, even though they were all fairly small.  All sorts of birds, like Bald Eagles, Ibises, whooping cranes,  flamingos, tall white birds with maribou on their heads, and many many more that I didn't know the name of. MY favorite was the pink Spoonbill bird. Never saw one before, and they are spectacular!  They have several there!In addition, there are alligators, turtles, black bears,wolves, bobcats, deer,  and more that I can't remember!! The best part is that this park is fairly clean and well maintained. The layout is very natural, and easy to walk. Unfortunately, we missed the underwater viewing area. Next time.Of course, the main attraction, the manatees, were there as well. Never saw one before!!! Impressive!! Due to the fact that the week before I got there was unseasonably warm, the wild manatees had returned to the Gulf to feed. Next time! We did get a glimpse of Lu, the hippo, and then I couldn't get the ""hungry hungry hippo"" song out of my mind.All in all, a terrific experience for a Minnesota girl. And I was ok with the fee to get in, as I know how much it cost just to feed all these birds and animals. It is heartwarming to know that many of the staff were volunteers.THANK YOU VOLUNTEER",aginggoddess,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Isanti,Minnesota,United States,Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/7/2019,The highlight was definitely watching the manatees feed on the romaine lettuce from below the water. Very cool to see the fish and manatees swimming up close. The remainder of the animals weren‚Äôt very active on the 80¬∞ afternoon and made for a bit of a boring walk for our kids.

2/28/2021,This was my first visit.  Everything was very clean.  They have wheelchairs to use for free which was great for my mother.  There was an area under the bridge where they fed the manatees.  In addition to seeing the couple of manatees eating several others swam up while we were there.  The other animals in the cages seemed to be well cared for.  Their doors to their back (out of view) areas were all open so the animals could leave the viewing areas if they chose to.  There were a lot of birds and alligators.  The bear was amusing to watch.  The panther was not interested and kept it's tail toward us.  We had a lovely time.

2/19/2020,"Easy to get to - then take the boat ride to the actual wildlife park and it is very informative, peaceful and pretty.  When you get to the wildlife park there is excellent signage to guide you so you see everything - the manatees!, the birds! (so beautiful!) Lou the hippo who is an official Florida resident as determined by the state legislature, the panthers, the bears, the snakes, the underwater viewing area where you see all kinds of fish, and if you are lucky, manatees.  We saw a baby and her parent!  Very special.  There are also presentations periodically throughout the day on various topics - very well done.  All creatures are native to Florida with the exception of Lou the hippo and if you take the boat ride you will hear all about how that came to be.   Really for a small park it is very diverse and well done.  For those who need it, wheelchairs are available.  There is a little cafe there too as well as a gift shop.  This is a park for all ages.  When you have seen it all you can take either the boat or a tram back to your car.  The price is very reasonable and you can get a coupon online but you need to print it out.",Lee R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dansville,New York,United States,Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Parktripadvisorreviews

2/27/2020,We got this recommendation from a couple we met in our hotel lobby.  It was a nice way to spend a few hours after we had spent the morning kayaking.  Lots of shade along the walking paths.  We went later in the day so a lot of the animals were on nap time but most were out in the exhibit.  One of the boats was not running when we got there and there was a long line.  They were not sure if they would get the boat running again so we moved over to the tram.  There was a very long line for that and they were originally only running one tram but they did finally start running two trams.  I understand that things break and there are issues but they did not seem to have a plan for this and so we wasted a quite a bit of time waiting for the tram.  Luckily that was not a problem when we were ready to leave.  All in all a nice day. Loved watching the river otters and the birds.  Didn't see any manatees as they had not come in yet but a relaxing afternoon.,alli1804,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Newtown Square,Pennsylvania,United States,Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Parktripadvisorreviews

Once you go into the visitor center right off highway 19, you pay your fee and choose tram or boat.  Boat.  Cruise down Pepper Creek with the driver telling you about some of the local critters and some of the history of the place.  Once there you can check out the FL wildlife exhibits.  The manatees are in their own natural spring area, and there is an underwater observation area on site where you can watch these creatures munch on romaine against the windows.  There is a hippo left from the zoo that used to be here.  The zoo tried to relocate but it was too hard, so the governor made him a honorary citizen of FL.  He has stayed - for over 50 years!  The birds, reptiles, and water creatures are well looked after and the site allows excellent viewing of these creatures.  There are bathrooms throughout.  There is a small restaurant for fast food.

We watched the manatee feeding and learned a great deal from the handlers.  Then we made it to the major bird pond and watched the feeding there.  Feeding times are 11:30, 1:30, and 3:30.

Nothing phony, just nature at its prettiest.

There are trails, bridges and boardwalks to follow around.

There were plenty of benches and shade. Some of the animals were clearly in their inside habitats as it was about lunchtime on a warm day. We would like to visit again either in the morning or later in the day when the animals might be more active. This is not a zoo and should not be treated as such. We were able to see one HUGE manatee that was hanging out near the feeding area. They had quite a few Covid-19 policies in place mainly some closed off areas to avoid close contact.

Even the cats (bobcats and panther) were out and active in spite of the heat and humidity.

There were lots of great birds and many other animals and were very active late in the day.  My pictures turned out great after 4pm - the lighting was excellent.

5/27/2019,"If you stay at the Bella Oasis hotel next door or park in the parking area of the Visitor Center on Rt. 19, your first park adventure begins with a lovely boat ride or a tram ride to the main entrance of the park.  At the main entrance, there is a cafe, gift shop and the ticket booth.  There are several shows during the day inside the park, plus a nice 1.10 mile nature trail to see birds and animals native to Florida such as bobcats, panthers and bears.  We especially enjoyed seeing all the birds native to Florida.  Although not native to Florida, there is a hippo residing in the park as well and they do hold birthday parties and other festivities for him throughout the year.  A unique feature of the park is the underwater observatory!  Here, visitors can watch the manatees underwater.  At designated times, the park employees feed the three resident manatees here.  They talk and answer questions about the park and manatees.  These three manatees live in the park year around so visitors always can see manatees, even out of season.  The best times to see many manatees are in January and February.  It was so interesting to see these lovely creatures so close and enjoying their lettuce!  The habitats for all the animals and birds are nicely done as they emulate their natural habitats.  The various birds, as well as the bobcats, were playing and looked so happy here.  There is an walk-in aviary with spoonbills and other birds which was a lot if fun.  When it is time to leave the park, the tram or the boat return fisitors to the visitor center on 19 where there is also another gift shop.

For a reasonable entry fee, you get a boat ride to see the water wildlife, then the chance to wander around a nice park to see many types of birds and animals.  There are scenic boardwalks and lots of information signs as you explore the park.  We saw alligators, a variety of birds, a hippo, manatees, foxes, and so much more.  If you are lucky and time it right, you can see the feeding of the manatees and hippo.  Very pleasant outing.

There's a small fee to be paid to get in, which you will most likely need to deposit in a drop box as no ranger will be present when you visit. There's a boardwalk off the Tamiami Trail, wich was closed at the time of our visit.

5/17/2019,"Big Cypress Bend Boardwalk is located 25miles out of Naples right on the Tamiami Trail E highway 90/41. It‚Äôs easy to miss if you‚Äôre not looking for it though, as the sign for it is on the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô side; is set back from the road and is dwarfed by a huge sign for a ‚ÄòGator Encounter‚Äô which grabs your attention. Once you‚Äôve doubled back to it, car parking is limited and is basically just by the side of the road with a few spaces set further back. The boardwalk is free, although a voluntary donation is requested. The first part of the walk is on a track following a stream down to the boardwalk, the stream was a cool hangout area for a Great Blue Heron. The wooden boardwalk is in excellent condition and takes you on quite a long walk through the vegetation and over the waters of the swamp. We saw plenty of fish; a few birds and a pencil thin snake sunning itself on the handrail. At the end of the boardwalk there is a viewing deck overlooking a pool, where there was a large alligator lounging in the reeds soaking up the sun. Our first wild Gator sighting during our month long road trip around Florida (didn‚Äôt even see one in Everglades NP!)

It became a little hairy in some spots, so an SUV is best if you are planning on driving in. We saw gators, deer and birds and lots of swamp flora. At 5:30, back at the main entrance, we boarded the tour trailer that seated about 17 people. Cushions were supplied. We headed back out on the road but this time made frequent stops. The 2 park staff educated us about everything Fakahatchee. They were wonderful!  We enjoyed a very cerebral evening. Our tour ended with a beautiful moon rise.

6/4/2019,"Adventuring we will go!  I had read in the early months of our relocation to Naples, FL about a remote dirt/gravel road off of SR 29 where you could see wildlife; with lots of sightings of ‚Äògators crossing the road or basking alongside. Wouldn‚Äôt that be interesting, I thought. Fast-forward a year and we decided to venture out to find this road less traveled.  It was slightly disappointing in that we didn‚Äôt see any alligators. But let‚Äôs face it, rainy season is just starting and there wasn‚Äôt a lot of water for ‚Äògator frolicking along Janes Scenic Drive in the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park. The State Park's website warns of using caution due to poisonous snakes in the area, especially if you are hiking. There are a few hiking trails for those seeking a bit of a challenge. Check the brochure or website for more details.What Mr. and I did take in during this Sunday afternoon journey were scenic views of natural landscapes that you‚Äôd expect to see in open lands where subtropical wildlife roam. No neatly trimmed palms here; it was nice to see the natural life of native foliage ‚Äì dead fronds, decaying logs and peeks of new undergrowth.  And it provided a clear view of what is under the water that accumulates and entices alligators, water fowl and other aquatic creatures to this area. It was okay that the only four-legged animals we spied were a couple of deer, because I was in awe of all the wildflowers along the way. So much in fact, I had Mr. stop frequently so I could get out of the vehicle to take some up-close photos of God‚Äôs creations. Some lesser exciting encounters - we noticed along this route, these enormous grasshoppers crawling across the road. At first, we thought it was a chance encounter to see one or two moseying across the road, but we soon discovered it was the entire length of this 5.5 mile road. It became a bit creepy seeing the numbers of them going to-and-fro. Speaking of the 5.5 miles; BE ADVISED! If you decide to take this driving tour, you will encounter a very rough road. Not just a few bumps in the road, mind you. We‚Äôre talking ruts that will cause some damage if you don‚Äôt use caution. There are even a couple of shallow muddy water-filled ruts reaching to either side of this narrow road. So, be prepared to make this drive slowly; you‚Äôll give your arms a work-out turning the steering back and forth as you maneuver the potholes. The drive actually starts winding through a wet prairie, though again, with the lack of rain so early in the season, it was just a prairie with palm tree islands dotting the open vastness. You‚Äôll approach the tree lined portion of the road a bit further in and this is where the road becomes rather treacherous with all the ruts. It appears the road through the prairie has had a recent layer of gravel/shell applied, so it‚Äôs less rutted ‚Äì for now. On this day we eventually caught up to a car that had started this drive before us. We just lingered back and spent time taking photos and of course dodging potholes - that alone kept a good distance between us. And as we were driving back along this route, we encountered two more vehicles heading in.Another tip you might want to heed before you venture on this drive ‚Äì stop at the Ranger station to deposit $3.00 in the honor box. When you know better, you do better ‚Äì and I say this because, we failed to read up on this before we took the drive. So, yes, we took the drive for free. However, we plan to return at some point, once the rainy season is in full swing, so we‚Äôll be depositing double the entrance fee ‚Äì promise! Do your research on this hidden gem of nature ‚Äì visit the website and learn about its history. You‚Äôll be surprised to learn why it‚Äôs called Janes Memorial Scenic Drive.

The boardwalk is easily accessed from awell marked  parking area on Tamiami Trail.  It is NOT located in the State Park area off of highway 29.  We made the mistake by not paying better attention.  The boardwalk is free, although a donation is requested which we were very glad to make by the conclusion of our walk.  And the boardwalk itself is well maintained.  There is a a range of vegetation appropriate for the Cedar Bend swamp area..  There are bizarre strangler trees right next to the boardwalk. (Watch for the one that brings up memories of the movie ""Alien.""   A bald eagle resides close by and we encountered several birders who were eager to point out its whereabouts.  The walk terminates in a wide decked cul de sac area allowing wonderful close viewing of a pond filled with water birds fishing for breakfast in the shallow waters, as well as an alligator lounging in the underbrush.  But best of all and unexpected was coming across two alligators thrashing and splashing and overturning themselves in an act of gator mating.  A small crowd congregated to watch.

Although we ended up with less time than anticipated as the rather rough, dirt road took some time to navigate to the trailhead, and with our timing only permitting a midday visit, never an ideal time to spot wildlife, we nevertheless did get to experience the swamp, seeing giant royal palms, large cypress trees, ferns, and even an ibis searching for a meal in a relatively short hike.We definitely need to return in the morning or latter in the day with more time to hike the trams and revisit the boardwalk; perhaps during the peak orchid month of November.",Steve5863,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Avon,Ohio,United States,Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Parktripadvisorreviews

On the negative, the circle trail (around the sinkholes) is totally shut off by walkways and stairs that have been broken and damaged by weathering and the state has not seen fit to fix it yet.

12/13/2019,"I was hoping to camp here but when I rolled up it was gated and closed, so i came back the next morning to check it out. They keep tight hours and the place is locked up like fort Knox otherwise. Once you get in there is a short trail from the parking lot leading down to the falls. There was a trickle of a falls when I visited, would likely be something to see in a heavy rainfall. The falls get their height from a limestone that has worn away beneath them and basically fall into a small hole in the ground. It's neat but not as amazing as you might  think given the height of the falls. It's worth the $5 entrance fee but if i spent an hour here, i'd be surprised.",TryppAdams,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Minneapolis,Minnesota,United States,Falling Waters State Parktripadvisorreviews
3/21/2019,"The camping area is fairly small, and not as much separation/privacy as most Florida parks.  Also, due to the layout, almost every site has an exceptional view of the restroom/shower.  Especially at night when you would probably rather be enjoying the view of the night sky.The big negative, however, is the excessive slopes in some of the sites.  Due to scheduling we had to move in the middle of our stay.  The first site took every block we had to get level, the next site wasn't as bad; however, it also required a few blocks (in a 32' class C).  If you're in a travel trailer/5th wheel, you probably won't have much of an issue.  The park is still recovering from Hurricane Michael, but the trail to the waterfall was easy to navigate.  The only real issue there is that the lower platform was still damaged.  However, there was still a good view of the waterfall.Finally, the thing we found most odd, was 4 sites out of 24 were assigned to campground hosts.  Seems like overkill.",Billy K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Livingston,Texas,United States,Falling Waters State Parktripadvisorreviews

There are many picnic tables surrounding the spring area to eat at, restroom facilities, a small playground and small walking trail.  The cabin was very clean and we loved the wraparound porch which had a picnic table within it, porch swing and several rocking chairs.  We grilled out for dinner and made a fire for the nighttime..all the benefits of camping with the ability to sleep in a bed with air conditioning and hang out on the covered porch when it got very dark.

6/26/2019,"We stayed a few nights in a cabin while we visited the springs in the area.  At the end of the day, my daughter loved Fanning Springs the best.  This might be because it's quite swimmable and she had it almost to herself the last evening we were there.  We visited Manatee Springs which are quite nice but more narrow so it seemed smaller.  And there were just so many snakes. Like, we lsot count after a while.  We saw them at both parks, but wow, Manatee Springs was a hot spot.  Lots of deer, a fox by our cabin and some armadillos passed through.The drive between the two parks is about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive.  If you are coming to one you should plan to do the other if only for a quick visit.  Fanning Springs has a nice picnic area, very small concessions, bathrooms, 6 cabins and maybe a few canoe rentals.  Manning Springs has a much larger setup for rentals, great BBQ menu on site (with beer and wine which is odd since there's a sign about no alcohol), bathrooms, picnic area and a regular campground, but no cabins.We visited two county park springs as well.  You must pay, but they have the entire setup as well with maybe a few more park structures such as playsets, etc..  Still like Fanning Springs the best, though.The cabin was ok.  We've stayed in a cabin at a different state park and had kind of the same feeling.  The idea is great and the cabin is so spacious, but it's kind of what they put in there that makes me not love it.  The towels are so paper thin and the kitchen, while stocked, seems like several people used it as an excuse to empty their own kitchens of unwanted utensils.  I think we had close to 15 large serving spoons.  Who needs that many spoons?  The dishwasher is the lowest model possible and really doesn't clean the dishes.  I oddly found myself cleaning dishes someone else put away dirty.It's nice you get your bedding wrapped so that you know it's clean.  However, the quilt I had for my bed, which I actually thought initially was cute and nice, had a large yellow stain on it.  I found this after sleeping in it for one night and that was simply yucky.There are two mismatched couches in the living room.  Each kind of aged looking and one had visible crumbs on it when we arrived.However, as I said, the idea is great.  Basically a home that will host a decent size family with everything you need short of laundry. And the outdoor screened porch is such a nice addition all by itself to be out of the weather or whatever.  The cabins just needs to be better staged.  So many people left glowing reviews in the guest book that I have to wonder what their own homes must be like if they think this place is so incredible.  Sorry, FL state parks.  Your parks rock, but I can't see staying in a cabin again.  The yellow stain was probably the final straw on that one.",JCJake,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Saint Paul,Minnesota,United States,Fanning Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

1/30/2021,"I got the opportunity to check out this place right before  Christmas. Pandemic protocols are in place which means tours limit the number of guests to ten per tour.Arriving at the park entrance, there's an entrance fee that varies with the number of occupants in your vehicle. Alone, my fee was just $4. There's a picnic area and some walking trails in the park. The caverns area is about a mile from the entrance and there's plenty of parking available. When I went (mid-week), tours were once per hour if I recall correctly...each starting on the top of the hour. I just missed the last one so I had about  45 minutes to kill. The workers in the gift shop (where you sign up for the tour) suggested a short walk to kill some time and also their little museum. In the museum, there's a film about the caverns that you can watch in lieu of doing the tour. Now the tour is an additional fee per person. For a single adult, my fee was $10 plus tax ($10.75 total).Your guide starts the tour outside with some local information. You then do a short walk to the cavern entrance. You go down several steps. You'll make several stops during your tour and your guide will provide you will all sorts of information about the caverns. Now the path inside does get narrow at points and you need to be able to duck down to get under low points. I believe the lowest ledge was 3' 11"". You're not allowed to touch...except for a select stalagmite. You're welcome to take pictures.I've been in several caverns with Carlsbad Caverns being the largest I've been into. This cavern is now the smallest I've been in. That doesn't mean it isn't spectacular in it own right. The biggest difference, in this cavern...you are really close to the walls and ceiling...but remember, ""Please Don't Touch""...yeah, that's how close you are. This cavern is also quite alive...so you'll probably get hit by dripping water several times. I didn't look at my watch, but I think the tour was somewhere between 60-90 minutes.Although I didn't ask specifically, I suspect the cavern itself is unable to become ADA compliant without severely destroying the cavern beauty. Again, you can watch a video tour film in the museum. The gift shop and museum appear to be ADA compliant...but the grade to the gift shop is a bit lengthy from the parking lot.This was a good place to kill some time. Being winter, a lot of trees were bare. I'd imagine things are quite different other times of the year.

Wear shoes with good traction and something that can get muddy, as there‚Äôs puddles throughout the caverns.

The cavern tour is scheduled at different times so it's good to call ahead to find out times.  There is a fee, and they have to  have a minimum of three people to do it for safety reasons, but I was there on a slow Friday morning and there were more than enough people each time.  The tour is about 45 minutes and since the electricity isn't restored yet, bring a flashlight, or purchase one there since the one they loan is not that bright.

The natural caves have been expanded to include decent walking paths although it does get a little tight at times with low ceiling heights and narrow passageways.  The added lighting inside makes it easy to see all the formations and the tour guides are all very knowledgeable about the history behind the caves.  Take a jacket as it is a little cooler inside and wear tennis shoes or hiking shoes as some areas are a little wet.  This park looks as if it was really nice at one time but apparently hurricane Katrina left some heavy damage and most other areas are closed.

3/1/2020,"My husband has osteoarthritis, I extensively explained health issues and questioned at the gate whether this might be considered too difficult for my husband‚Äôs capabilities.  I actually asked, if we  commenced the tour and found it beyond our capabilities, was there a way to discontinue the tour.  We were advised there are multiple exits to discontinue.  Having never been in any caverns, I had little idea what to expect and felt that we were not appropriately advised.  There had been flooding, so the tour was thankfully much shorter as many of the cavern rooms were inaccessible.  The tour, though interesting, was considerably more challenging than my husband could comfortably handle.  There were not any easy egresses or exits.  The only option would have been to discontinue the tour and inconvenience everyone on the tour by going back.  There were some narrow pathways while going downhill on very uneven wet slippery ground, while ducking due to low ceilings.  There was a very kind traveler who was holding his other hand and holding her hand over his head on low ceilings, while I held his left hand and led the way.  This wound up being a traumatic experience and I was disappointed in not being provided appropriate information, after I specifically asked so many questions which were not answered accurately, and, I feel put us in harms way.

But the reason I only give it three stars is because the guide we had was a fifteen year old high schooler who had no grasp of the English language and simply regurgitated a memorized shtick.

We got there by 8:45 am and registered for a 10:30 am tour.  (during covid, your must get there early or the tours will be booked up for the day. They are restricting the amount of people in a tour to 10.) After we registered we left the park and checked out of our hotel and then came back.  You are allowed to re-enter the park with your original receipt for the day. The park entry for the vehicle was about $5.00.  The tour was $10.00 per person. There is generally some hiking to do in the park as well, but that is pretty much off limits because of Hurricane damage. We had a great guide, he added to the experience so much.  I wish I could remember his name for any one who reads this.  He is a man in his sixties maybe, white(Not Asian) with a last name that made me think he was going to be Asian.

7/20/2019,"I had visited Florida Caverns outside Marianna 40+ yrs ago and was curious how much if any it had changed. There is a small but interesting museum there now, a gift shop and the tour of the cave that is still open. The campground, golf course, and pool area appears to still be under repair and remodel since Hurricane Michael. We signed up for the tour with Ranger Rick around noon and had a fun interesting flashlight tour which was reminiscent of the time I came over 40yrs ago. The rock formations of stalactites and stalagmites appear healthy and still growing. I never saw the cave with lights inside on the formations so I didn‚Äôt miss it but I heard others saying how nice it used to be with the lights. They still perform weddings in the cave at the Wedding Cake Rock formation - about a couple a year. The path was not bad to walk on and Ranger Rick did a good job of keeping our group of 23 together and safe in the low rock ceilings where we had to duck and squeeze to get through a couple of room connectors. We saw several small sleeping bats and cave crickets that paid no attention to us. The 3-4 children with us seemed to enjoy the tour as much as the adults did. No strollers are allowed and carrying a child might be dangerous trying to get through some of the paths, so I highly suggest making sure your child is old enough to walk and stay by your side. I would say the children in our group ranged from 4 - 9 yrs of age. The tours were every hour. There is a video in the Museum where you can watch and see what happens on the tour. We watched it after our tour to hear some of the explanations we missed and didn‚Äôt hear with our large group. It was a well done video of a live tour. All in all good value and enjoyable to us.

You can bring your own flashlight or the park will provide some for you. The entire staff at the park is very friendly. I would recommend wearing sport shoes. No backpacks allowed. The caverns are easy to navigate. There are two areas in the cavern were you have to crouch down to get through.,happymom94,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Alabama,Alabama,United States,Florida Caverns State Parktripadvisorreviews

Joe, who was masked, took our admission fees. He was friendly and shared a lot of information with us. We also took a map of the museum and a map for the Cracker House, which Joe told us was built in 1860s - original house except for roof. We only had 30 minutes to look around the museum and house. In the museum, we read as many of the informative displays as we could. We enjoyed the exhibits with stuffed animals and signs identifying them.

The entrance fee to the fort is an additional $2.50 a person (total $11.00 is very reasonable). Entrance is through the impressive visitor center which is full of artefacts/memorabilia and information. The fort contains many well maintained buildings, and although there is a lack of written info, the rooms are dressed so that you can see what their function was. Two ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù who could answer questions were also about. The view of the beach, ocean and shoreline from the top of the battlements is great. We found the fort to be very interesting.

Preserving a really beautiful maritime forest draped in Spanish Moss, walking the trails is a great experience and gives you an idea of what it must have been like before development came to the island. The beach is pretty and parts of it overlook Cumberland Island to the north; at times the wild horses are visible if you have good optics for viewing.

The most interesting part to me was this is a Union fort, not Confederate.  You get to walk around inside the Fort, go into the buildings, and climb up to the wall.  You can walk right up to the big cannons on the wall.  There are signs that explain what you're seeing, and a person dressed in period clothing to ask questions.You can also walk down to the beach in front of the Front on the Amelia River.

One night we stayed in space 44 which was right across from the restroom/ bath house. Perfect for our class c 32 ft RV. The next night we had to move over to spot 45 which was also spacious and shady. The restroom was super clean and the showers were nice. This park was easy to maneuver and navigate around. Each space has water and electricity but no sewer there is a dump station that was easy enough to dump. The fort was about a 20 walk away from the river loop. Definitely worth visiting. One of the nicest forts we have seen. Lots of hiking trails, bring bikes if you have them. The campground is also close to the historic district which has shops and restaurants. We wanted to check it out on our way out of town. So we drove to veterans Central Park and parked the RV there then walked about 10 minutes to the downtown.

8/6/2019,Fort Clinch is my favorite as they have amazingly clean rest rooms.  There is no lifeguard and there is a fee for park entrance.  This keeps the beach uncrowded and the restrooms clean.  It is a tranquil place to spend the day....the ride in through a canopy of  trees adorned with Spanish moss sets the tone for your visit.  The park has a very nice camp ground that is in demand.  There is also a fort for history buffs with a nominal  entrance fee.  Shark tooth hunting is also good at this location!,patri0rdan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fernandina Beach,Florida,United States,Fort Clinch State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/30/2019,"We always bring our company for a day at Fort clinch. Not only is it the most beautiful old Florida treasure, but you have the ocean for swimming, fishing or simply hunting for sharks teeth.

7/18/2019,"We had so much fun exploring the beaches. We did not go into the fort. Swimming is prohibited by the fort due to the strong current, but that should not deter anyone from putting on a bathing suit and stunt for shark teeth. There is a swimming beach on the other side of the park. The park is well kept and fun to explore in a bike.",Annie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Indiantown,Florida,United States,Fort Clinch State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/17/2019,"This was our last stop before driving to the airport to fly home. We parked and walked the trail loop. It is VERY woodsy and left pretty natural. Lots of spider webs, mud slides where gators move around the swampy areas etc. I will admit I was a little creeped out :)We then drove down to the beach area and parked. It is a significant walk from the lot down a boardwalk then across the beach itself to get to the water.There was only 1 other family walking the beach. Would be a great spot for a picnic or to sit and read. The view of the fort from the beach and the sailboats going by also make it a great picture spot.We saw that there were camping areas and the ability to pay and tour the fort. Very large property with lots to explore and just a few dollars to get into the park itself.

7/16/2019,"Fort Clinch State Park is filled with plenty of activities for enthusiasts of all types. There is the original old Fort Clinch along with the visitor center/museum and tour of the site which provides nice opportunities for history lovers. There are many, many bike and hiking trails throughout this park and they are well marked and maintained. The paved road through the park is also easily used by those who enjoy biking on paved roads too and the trees provide a shady canopy over much of the trails.When hiking and biking on the nature trails, there is a lot of wildlife in Fort Clinch State Park and you are apt to encounter some of the critters as you are out and about. There is a birding boardwalk trail exhibit with some explanatory placard displays about the birds found on Amelia Island. The boardwalk leads all the way down to the ocean beach and there are public restrooms available in this area.In addition there is a very, very nice public ocean beach inside the beach with a large parking area and another boardwalk leading right down to the ocean beach. Restrooms are available and showers to wash off the salt and sand before leaving are also available here. This is an area where you can search for sharks teeth and seashells and it is not overly populated with visitors as are some of the other public access beaches. The beach is clean and more quiet as well since it is away from all of the restaurants that amp up the music quite loud sometimes. There is a pleasant picnic area with tables There is a playground for children to play and have fun.There is a great campground.The entrance fee is not costly at all and the vehicle ticket is good for the whole day. If you leave to go out, you can just show your entrance fee ticket to re-enter the park at no charge. This state park is a great way to have some wonderful fun with so many exciting options within the one park. Plenty of parking located at each of the areas.",GaryandDenise2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lake Alfred,Florida,United States,Fort Clinch State Parktripadvisorreviews

The park was well kept and clean. The staff who greeted us at the entrance was friendly and greeted us with a smile.  The beach area was nice and the sand was clean.  I would say that the picnic area could use pavillion type coverings for the tables because eating out in the blazing sun was uncomfortable.

5/21/2019,"Spent a week in the Riverside campground (under a beautiful canopy of trees) in our travel trailer instead of the beachside super sunny campground (wonderful to have choices).  The campground hosts & workcampers we encountered have done a great job with the cleanliness of the campgrounds & bath houses. Well behaved pets are allowed in the campground but not on any beach or in any building; pretty standard for FL state park system.While there we fished on the riverside, inlet & ocean surf from shore with some catching but nothing to keep & cook. Was able to bicycle to watch sunrises over the ocean almost every morning & walk to the edge of our campground to watch the sunset over the river every night.  Wildlife is active - deer, tortoises, armadillos, raccoons (dang bait stealers - even ate the artificial stuff overnight!), incredible bird variety, coyotes & even managed a pic of what may be bobcat tracks on the beach.Spent a few hours touring the fort - architecture & information (self guided) was quite interesting & the views of Cumberland Island wild horses from the top was great (carry binoculars).  Spent a couple days hanging on the beach - so quiet during the week but a bit busy on the weekend (still comparatively empty).

It felt like a journey into Florida's prehistoric past. When we came out of the long trail and back onto the main park road, the sun was beating down on us, and I managed to flag down a volunteer driving by in a golf cart, and she offered water to Foxxe.

6/17/2019,"The fort is fun to explore. There were a couple of men in Civil war era costumes standing around, which was unusual but I suppose good for people with questions. (They were friendly). It was pouring rain when we visited and it was still a fun time. You can go into most of the buildings and look around to get out of the rain or the sun. The best part is the view when you go up by the cannons that look out to sea. It's a good time if you like history. There is a small museum too which really helps give you the context of the place. As for the state park itself, we did not stay overnight. It is beautiful to drive through it though and we did stop and look at some of the natural sites. We went onto the beach hoping to swim but not only was it raining and threatening to storm but there were big waves. There was also a confusing area with rocks on the beach going out into the water, and a sign that warned people not to go north of it, or north of something, we were not sure what the warning was referring to. So we just stayed out of the water. There are many more swimming  beaches on the island.There is a nice little gift shop at the entrance to the Fort.

Plenty of trails and lookouts along the way, as well as bike paths so beware of bikers. The fort entry is another $2.50 per person. It overlooks the water and you can also walk to the beach from the fort. It is a very well preserved brick fortification with great views of the water and Cumberland Island.

For campers, there are about 60 sites...however if you want to camp there reservations need to be made well in advance.",Linda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Phippsburg,Maine,United States,Fort Clinch State Parktripadvisorreviews

The road from the park entrance was about 3 mi before you got to the park. but be advised travel slow on the road because there was lots of bikers enjoying this area as well. The fort was a nice piece of history to explore and either you can do it by yourself or you can follow a tour guide. The temperature was around 61 so it was perfect since is really not too much shade to protect you.if you have an hour or two of your day if you're in the area I would recommend checking this place out.,John C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Fitchburg,Massachusetts,United States,Fort Clinch State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/4/2019,"We  wanted to visit the Fort Clinch State Park on Amelia Island,, but we had no idea the first Saturday/Sunday as well as a few other weekends are reenactment dates. The first part of the visit begins with a short film and a tour of a small museum. However, the real museum was the outdoor reenactment and lovingly restored barracks. The reenactors were deeply into their roles from the drummer and piccolo player to the ""fort doctor"" and the ""quartermaster"" characters, We were allowed to explore every corner of the Fort from the jail to the bakery where we even tasted fresh baked bread from the Fort's ovens. This fort for defense and if necessary war. Our East Coast was initially very vulnerable to marauders and just the presence of this facility provided safety to the United States when it was needed. The State of Florida wisely. included this property as one of its earliest state parks in their system. It was $3 per carload and an extra $2.50 per person to enter the Fort. There is a nice gift shop with restrooms, over 60 camp sites, and plenty of beach access.

7/15/2019,"I last reviewed 5 years ago but have gone back at least 2-3 times including this year.  For starters, this is a cheap trip.  $6 for a car to get in.  Even if you're by yourself, the most you pay after getting in (unless you're camping) is $2.50 for access to the fort.  You drive maybe a mile or a little more to the parking area. It's a small road through a heavily forested area with some trails for walking and biking.  We've hiked there in the past but I wouldn't consider myself totally comfortable with all the insects nature has to offer and I remember more than a few spider webs along the trail that you have to watch out for.  Anyway, I did the fort tour again and because I've been on it several times, I always try to focus on a different area.  This year, I just happened to catch a really fascinating talk in the medical area.  A retired nurse was doing the show and tell and it was great how she wove in medicines and tools we use today when they were the same or similar to what was used back then.  I have forgotten her name unfortunately but it was very enjoyable.  She did a great job.There is a candle light tour that usually takes place on Friday and Saturday after sunset.  I will plan to do that next year.The pier is gone.  I believe it was gone last year too.  It's unfortunate as it was a very long pier and great to walk.  One of the hurricanes did too much damage and it was too expensive to repair vs. removing.  I think building a new pier will depend on fund raising.  Even without the pier, there's still a great beach area for walking, etc.Definitely recommend.",2BEis2SKI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Charlotte,North Carolina,United States,Fort Clinch State Parktripadvisorreviews

12/6/2019,"My sister and I visited Fort Clinch State Park on the last Thursday afternoon of September 2019. It is just a short (2 miles maybe?) drive from the Amelia Island Historic District.There is a fee of $6 per car to enter the State Park.  The entry fee is worth it!  The drive along the road is scenic and beautiful, and allows you access to the park's amenities -- there is a picnic area, restrooms, an area for overnight camping, an area for bird watching, access to the beach, and access to Fort Clinch.There is a separate fee of $2.50 per person to enter Fort Clinch.  You enter and exit and pay your admission fee at the Fort Clinch Visitor Center.  It begins with a self-guided tour of the museum, with interesting and informative displays as well as videotaped information one may watch.  Upon exiting the museum you approach the Fort and may explore to your heart's content.  The history is interesting and informative, and the view of the ocean over the walls of the fort is breathtaking. I literally could have spent hours exploring except for one thing:  it was HOT!  Even though it was a fall day, the afternoon sun combined with the high humidity made the heat very uncomfortable for me (and I imagine, others who may not be used to how humidity affects our perception of heat).  I definitely recommend taking a bottle of water to stay hydrated, and seeking out shady areas to cool off as you explore (I recommend the breezeway; it was dark and shaded and true to its name, had a nice cooling breeze).We drove to other areas inside the park as well.  We drove to the beach access area, but I was still very overheated from walking all over the Fort, so when I saw the long boardwalk leading from the park to the beach, I decided against walking down to the water in favor of air conditioning!Overall, a very lovely day filled both with history and scenic beauty.

8/6/2019,"It was very interesting to visit.  The way the buildings were constructed and the items from the past.  I was a little disappointed in the men that were supposed to be in uniform and interact with the visitors.  There was no interaction - they were sitting down looking like they were bored out of their minds.   Quite a different scenario than we were given about visiting the place.  But they didn't make it or break it....  We did not go out to the beach area although it looks like it would be nice if you're a beach comber.  I would say that considering the history of Amelia Island, it is worth a visit for sure!",SWooten82,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Simpsonville,South Carolina,United States,Fort Clinch State Parktripadvisorreviews

Growing up in Tampa, as a family, my father took us to all the historical sites on the East Coast he could find...he was a history major...Spanish American historic sites, battleship ports from each war, spaceships at Cape C.  This was special because I went with my English husband!  Glad to see he enjoyed it too...a lot!  The fort is kept clean and restored by money from visitors.  A small amount to pay!  We would have paid more!  The museum is small, but has some great pieces! The staff is friendly and the stuff we purchased there‚Äôs very nice!  Great place to ride to on scooters rented from Road Shark Rentals, or bikes!  We think we will camp there next time!

4/22/2019,"Honestly, the 3/4-mile(?) drive from Atlantic Avenue to the historic fort is worth the price of admission. Huge old live oaks overhang the narrow roadway, with Spanish moss dangling nearly to the roof of your car. I had to stop just to take a photo, it was so gorgeous. We've been to more impressive forts, but the view of the beach, ocean and shoreline from the top of the fort is great. As for the historical information, there was very little. No interpreter; just a guy standing there monitoring the visitors entering and exiting. One thing that was great was that some of the rooms in the living quarters were furnished. For example, it was very cool to see the enlisted soldiers' rooms outfitted with bunkbeds, table, and benches as they would have looked at the time.

You get to envision the hard working slaves working the house gardens and the acres of Sea Island cotton. The Kingsley Plantation where the owners lived is open for visits on the weekend, but the kitchen remains open for visitation as does the Clubhouse. This plantation ownership was different than almost every other plantation in the South. The mistress, or wife of the owner, was a Senegalese woman with strong business skills. The Ribault Club House Visitor's Center is also open.  It is very interesting to study the ""tabby"" material used to build the structures in this park.

We went on low tide, and clearly you cannot launch from land inside Mose State Park during low tide, however, I would like to try it some time during high tide - it's a long haul from the Vilano launch.",floridatraveler33,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jacksonville,Florida,United States,Fort Mose Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews

I learned how in the 1700's, the Spanish, Africans and Indians, lived together in the St Augustine, sharing their culture, religion, food, and their dress. Africans created a community in Fort Mose to be the first line of Defense against the British. The museum describes how they lved, worked and protected St Augustine. It has some cool interactive aspects for kids and adults. If you want to learn about something that is litte known, come here.

There is currently no actual Fort on the property but they have a very informative information center that provides a great historical view of the freed slaves and Spanish slaves role in the protection of St Augustine through Spanish and British governments. There is a nice picnic area, a couple with roofs and a grill but most are only tables that are well shaded by large oak trees, so do take a picnic. There are a couple of short trails that take you over the marsh to where the Fort was located. Entry to the info center was only $2 per person, kids free.  If you want to just do the trails there is no charge.  This place is much quieter and less hectic than downtown.

The introductory video and museum were informative and well done. We happened to arrive In time to see some of the militia reenactment, which was also very interesting to see. The outdoor area is largely a work in progress, and fundraising is underway to construct a replica of the old fort. We did a couple of short nature walks on the property and enjoyed the peaceful setting just minutes from the overcrowded streets of St Augustine. We were delighted to have discovered this jewel.

While the state park is nice -the walkway where you can go out into the water and watch the para-sail surfing for free is far more entertaining!  On another note - we were laughing as we watched a couple of ladies with their dogs walking up and down the beach front with signs all over saying ""NO PETS ON THE BEACH""  - I guess they didn't think their dogs were pets.  We also saw a lot of state park employees just hanging around doing nothing - smoking and chatting.

For those driving, there were plenty of parking spaces just a few feet from the beach.  Cost in 2019 is $2.50 per walker and $7.50 per car load up to three people.  After that, 50 cents per person.  The beach is peaceful, lots of gulls and a few pelicans, and those who come for sun and swimming mostly depart as the sun drops low.

I wish the weather had cooperated so that I could have spent more time there.  All day was not enough time!  There is a concession stand and a place to rinse off.

There weren't too many people here, and there were fairly nice facilities, and a small beach snack bar. The snack bar generally had a really long line, but it was nice to have the option for food and drinks. I thought there were plenty of picnic tables, and room to lay on the sand.

Bring your own cooler of food/beverages or visit the cafe.  There are also facilities at this beach.  The views are beautiful during the day and because it's on a point you can look toward Key West at the cruise ships if they are docked.  There is an entrance fee to enter this park where your receipt will provide you re-entry on the same day should you return and there is lots of parking.

We heard there was good snorkeling, but the water was so murky we could barely see our hands in front of us. To be honest, this was a couple of days after Hurricane Laura passed the Keys; we did not expect the water to still be roiled up (guess we were wrong).

11/18/2019,"2019 Fort Zachery Taylor, Key WestIf you are interested in the Civil War, this fort is for you. It is one of three forts not taken by the Confederacy‚ÄîFort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas (a 3 hour ferry from Key West can get you there) and Fort Pickens in Pensacola being the other two.  Today, the fort‚Äîknown as Fort Zach in Key West-- and surrounding eighty plus acres is operated by the State of Florida.  Biking or walking in only cost $1.50, a car a bit more.  It is actually just a short walk to the famous Key West‚Äôs Duvall Street. The ramparts do provide a nice view of the waters surrounding Key West. Fort Zachery Taylor was actually at one time three stories high‚Äîtoday, two stories.  In the 1960‚Äôs the authorities excavated the largest collection of Civil War cannons ever found in the USA.  It is not an overly large fort as it could hold 800 men. Like Fort Jefferson, it was never attacked.The fort is named after the USA‚Äôs 12th President.  He died just a few months before the completion of the fort.  The Historic State Park does have a beautiful beach.  Those in the know usually go snorkeling there.  Civil War reenactments do go on at this fort.  During the first weeks of November, locals like to sit along the rocks and watch the International Boat Races.

11/12/2019,It's a very nice place to come and relax as it is inside the park it has picnic tables to cook out and has a pavilion with showers and a snack bar. The entrance fee gets you to both the civil war fort and the beach. We paid only 7 for the two of us and we were also able to watch the offshore boat races along the rocks. I would definitely highly recommend bringing some water shoes because the beach has a slight drop which has rocks which may hurt your feet. But other than it's a great place to spend the day.,Steve L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Everglades,Florida,United States,Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews

All is at your disposal.  You can even stay for the sunset.  The beach has more crushed coral than a typical sandy beach.  However, there is also a treed area that boarders the entire beach complete with picnic tables, grills, concession stand(including restrooms) and chair rentals so you can spend the day in and out of the sun.

6/4/2019,"The fort is kind of cool to walk through, if you‚Äôre going definitely try to catch the free tours, I believe they‚Äôre at 11:00 and 1:00 but please check the website for the correct times. The fort is not huge so it won‚Äôt take more than an hour or so to walk around. Everyone said the beach there was really good. I was underwhelmed by it after reading so many reviews. I will say we stayed at a resort with it‚Äôs own beach so the comparison was unfair. Also because Key West is not known for having great beaches it probably is good. We saw a couple other free public beaches Ike Smathers and Brothers that we‚Äôre better. We did not have the opportunity to try snorkeling at Ft Taylor though so perhaps that would‚Äôve changed my opinion. We also didn‚Äôt have time to go on the many trails at the park. If we had our kids with us we could‚Äôve packed picnic and spent the whole day just enjoying the lush park, trails, beach, and fort.

We enjoyed exploring it on our own.  We then went to the beach area. It is a hard rock that was not at all what we are used to for a beach. You absolutely need water shoes to walk on beach as well as in the water. I had read reviews that snorkeling was good, but I couldn't see anything on the day (April 15) we were there. Our umbrella would not stay up in the rocks either, so it wasn't the best beach experience for us. Under the trees was breezy and nice though for picnics and relaxing. Overall, we had a good day, but we prefer sand beaches. I was also disappointed that I couldn't see anything snorkeling. I went as far as the boys would allow, but no luck.

3/6/2020,"We rode bicycles there from Eaton Street via Simonton Street and a right on Petronia which is pretty much a straight path there.  There are bicycle lanes going into the area and if you have a group going, pay for all parties together, there is a discount for that.  There are many bike racks and good parking for vehicles there.  Numerous picnic tables and shaded spots along with a small sand and stony beach area.  You can rent chairs there and get a snack from their food stand, which also has assorted beers.  Note, beers must be consumed on the deck of the food area and cannot be taken on the beach.  You can purchase snorkel equipment in the small gift shop, we saw a few snorkeling there.  I love that there is a box of beach toys you can use and donate to on the deck of the food area, great idea!  A few foot showers wash off showers are to the left of the food stands so you can remove sand and debris.  You definitely want to wear water shoes the beach was stony and not soft sand.  It was pretty crowded on February 26th when we visited and windy but walking the beach was nice.  The water is beautiful and you can see all the water traffic at the end of the park.  The bathrooms had very wet floors, toilets cramped space, blow dryers for hands were not strong and I'm not sure I'd want to change in there.  But, people are wet coming in from water activities so I kept that in mind as well.  The fort structure is something to see so dont miss it.

The restrooms are clean and have a locker rental close by the beach.  No jellyfish.  Because it is a national park, although small, it charges a fee for admittance and is guarded, so it is very secure.

Not only did  he tell the history of the fort, from how it was built to how it was used to the present day, he also answered many questions of what we were seeing.

We went to this beach twice while we visited key west and spent the whole day there each time. We rented chairs and an umbrella for $30 and paid a small fee to get in (I think $7.50 for 2 adults and one kid). We brought a cooler with snacks and drinks although it isn‚Äôt necessary because there is a nice concession stand right by the the beach. We snorkeled and saw lots of fish and our daughter was able to swim in the little cove while we watched from the beach chairs. You see the big cruise ships going in and out of port, lots of birds and even a huge iguana hanging out by the rocks. The only part I didn‚Äôt like was the very crowded bathrooms. Only 4 stalls were functioning and most people were using them as changing rooms. The line got very long at one point and really they need to just add some changing rooms so that people can get to a toilet if they need one.

We rode our bikes into the oark and oaid a small state park entrance fee.  Just like all the beach areas, the seaweed accumulates on the beach and is smelly.  However if you just walk upwind is not bad at all.  We rented lounge chairs for ten dollars each.  The umbrellas were all taken so we found some shade under trees which worked fine for our group of four.  We did get in the water but did not get snorkel gear.  After our beach time we visited the fort which was interesting enough to stop but super hot since its out in the open so do take water.  There are fountains at the restrooms on your way in.  Overall a good visit.",bagelhead,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Greensboro,North Carolina,United States,Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews

4/14/2019,Definitely take a few hours and explore this park. The fort is interesting and will take 30-45 minutes to tour. The real reason to go is the beach there. A nice sandy stretch of beach with umbrellas available to rent. Also a snack bar as well. You can drive to the park or walk which we did. Be forewarned it is quite a trek from duval st.

The fort is like most other forts I've seen throughout the U.S - but worth a few minutes.  The park was very clean, water blue - but defintely not impressed with the beach.  That said, anyone who has been to Key West knows you don't go for the beaches.

10/20/2019,"Let me start with saying Key West is not known for their beaches and you will never find this beach on any list of Best Beaches.  However if you want to feel the saltwater on you skin while on the island, this is the place to do it.  The is plenty of sand mixed in with the rocks.  The seaweed is at a minimum.  The water is very clear and there are plenty of fish to see as the swim among your legs.  We were lucky enough to see a couple of Parrot Fish.  There is a snack bar that offers a surprising array of food and drink choices.  There is also a concession that offer chair and umbrella rentals.  We got two chairs and an umbrella.  We considered renting masks and snorkels but decided not too since the fish were so abundant and easily viewed from the surface.

There was some sargassum on the sand but not floating in the water to the point that you couldn‚Äôt get in the water. I would just suggest sand shoes as it is rocky getting out to the water.

Bonus - grills on site!Didn't try any of the concessions, but it is good to have the option.I also didn't snorkel since the water was a bit choppy but no problem.

If you didn't bring gear, you can rent gear. We brought our own, so I don't know the rental fees.  They have a website that might include the rental fees. They have showers you can use to shower off after your day here. The fort has a daily tour at 11.  We missed this, but were still able to walk around and learn about the history.

The fort is in excellent condition and was fun for everyone to explore.  I also noticed they had ranger led tours.  Nice views and lots of fun places for the kids to explore.Returned later in the day to enjoy the beach (your admission fee is good all day).  It was a decent beach for the keys.  A little rocky and a little murky for snorkeling, but the kids had fun.

Nice concession stand, facilities and some picnic tables.  The fort was more interesting to us. We like historical sites.  Learned a lot about Zachary Taylor and the history of the fort. Once was probably enough for us. If you have several days in Key West and want to relax by the water this is a fine place. Don't expect sandy beach, though! Bring money to pay for parking.

3/20/2020,"We came to snorkel, because we heard the snorkeling was really good here. I don‚Äôt know if we just went on a bad day, but snorkeling in the main beach was terrible. It was really cloudy and you couldn‚Äôt see anything. Also, the beach is really rocky, so bring water shoes if you can. We also saw a Man o‚Äô war jellyfish, which has a very painful sting, washed up on the beach. There was only one and it was near the rocks. That was the only one we saw, but if you go stay alert.Even though the main beach area wasn‚Äôt very good for snorkeling on the day we went, we took a trail along the rocks to a hidden beach. It was sheltered from the wind so the waves weren‚Äôt as big and we were able so snorkel. It was a pretty good snorkel spot. We saw a lot of little fish. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.

1/21/2020,First my husband is really into this Fort stuff.  I go along but my interest is not as much as his. We got to the gate and they told us if we were interested a tour was about to start.  Best tour I have done at one of these is a long time.  Our ranger was Grim and he LOVES his job and explaining this place to you.  He made it interesting for me as well.  I think the tour was suppose to be 90 minutes but we had a small group and Grim went on for two hours.  It was above and beyond.  I really want to thank him for his time.  Then we went to the beach area.  It was nice.  There are some picnic tables and we had a nice lunch with a great view.  Probably one of the best beaches in Key West.  There is a food/drink spot if you didn't bring your own lunch.  You can rent chairs if you don't wan to sit on a towel on the beach.  It appears you can also bring your own.  It is beautiful water and great environment. Highly recommend it.,J E,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Austin,Texas,United States,Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews

I recommend getting to the fort in the morning; there's not much breeze inside that area, so it's a little warm.  The beach was nice and clean, although it's not a typical sandy beach, as there's a lot more crushed coral.  Nice place to snorkel, as well.  There's a shaded area with tables, which made a great place to get out of the sun and enjoy the sea breeze.  An easy bike ride or moderate walk from town, as well.

5/31/2019,"This was a pleasant little surprise on our trip. We had friends who have a park pass that got us in for free, otherwise you have to pay to get in. If you park and then head left on the beach you‚Äôll find an area with benches and shade do you can hang out and keep your stuff off the ground. If you‚Äôre will to splash the cash you can have an umbrella and chair set out for you. There is also a little foods shack and bath rooms. The big pickle isn‚Äôt as nearly big as the $3 price tag suggests it should be.  However it was still decent. We ordered fries and quesadilla - decent just not very large for the pricing. Try it and you understand what I mean. The shack also serves beer but u clear about Mixed drinks. Pro-tip: pack your own cooler and save the money, while the shack is a good backstop nothing beats cooler beer and or drinks. If you want a mixed drink get it prepped ahead of time, and bring ice in a separate cooler so you can have a nice freshly iced drink that didn‚Äôt have r a bunch of hands in it like the beer cooler. WARNING: you will want water shoes or something else to get you into the water. The beach itself is fine, but once you get a few steps into the water I found it difficult to get in.

5/9/2019,"Whether you're in Key West for the history, the culture, the beaches, the scenery, or the sunsets, this place has it all! We had the pleasure of hosting our daughter's wedding reception in this great fortress so during our trips to scope out the place and meet with the staff, we were able to enjoy the beach and it's crystal clear water, the view from both the beach and the fortress rooftop, and the history of this Civil War-era gem! The fortress' rooftop itself gives a great view of the Atlantic and Key West dockside/waterfront, particularly during those spectacular sunsets! I much preferred sunset here than in the crowded rowdy Mallory Square. Another great view of sunset is possible from the beach. As I said, we had a wedding reception here, inside the fortress, and had a blast! Strung lights, subtle amber uplighting, candlelight on the tables, and a clear tent surrounded by white lights were the perfect backdrop for a relaxed cocktail reception, sit-down dinner, and a full-night of dancing! We couldn't have asked for a more magical place for everyone to celebrate such a happy occasion! And the staff bent over backwards to help us plan and execute the event plans.

2/18/2021,"Fort Taylor Park has two components to it: the historic civil war fort and a beach and picnic area.  While the Park seems very popular, it's hard to understand why.The fort is imposing and interesting to tour, but it's neither very historic (never fired a shot in battle) nor especially well preserved (originally three levels, it was later reduced to one level, and little is left of it besides a main wall and some cannon).  The beach area is even more disappointing.  It's a narrow beach, with about 50 feet from the tree line to the shore.  The beach itself is very rocky, with little more than patches of sand.  The water is warm and pleasant but filled with seaweed.  Although snorkeling gear is offered for rent, the water is too cloudy to see very much.While I was here, my feeling was that there must be better beaches in a place like Key West.",Brendan S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Arlington,Virginia,United States,Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/3/2019,"We chose Key West for a vacation because we wanted the best snorkeling in the USA, and Key West regularly came up as the top pick.  Well don't believe it.We tried Higgs beach and Fort Zachary Taylor both, and BLECH the snorkeling blows.  Fort Zach especially is a problem because the beach is covered with painful rocks, out into the first few feet of water, making it painful as hell to approach the water.  Then once you're in the water, there are really only four spots to snorkel at, each being a large pile of rocks.  Unfortunately the wildlife there just isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Some basic fish, nothing very colorful.  The rocks are just covered in mud or slime, so again, nothing very colorful.  And the overall wave action means that the water as a whole is pretty churned up, limiting visibility.Do yourself a favor and pay for a snorkeling tour out at the reef.

It was led by a very informative ranger who answered lots of questions and gave us a comprehensive history of the fort as well as Key West information. Maybe because our group had so many questions, our 45 minute tour was over an hour.  This also gave us background information for visiting Ft Jefferson which was built in a similar design and time frame.After the tour we walked on down to the beach area which seemed very nice and had a small cafe and additional restrooms.

The beach was gorgeous, Caribbean style, turquoise sea with white coral sand, water warm. No need to rent chairs and umbrellas, as there's plenty of tree shade. We had two swims before heading to explore KW.The in-park brick civil war fort is OK to see, but nothing spectacular.TIP: You cannot leave your car on the parking lot here and go exploring KW (it's also pretty far from the main sights).

9/23/2019,"Fort Zachary is phenomenal, and a hidden gem of Key West.  The island itself isn't that big, with a lot of great bars and restaurants, and you never would have thought you could hit a beautiful park with a clean, well kept beach, and a historical fort to boot!  It's the best $4 you'll spend on the island (this was a single person in a car price, it's more if you have more people in your car).  I spent the majority of my time at the fort inside of Fort Zachary and it was such a beautiful site.  I love all the history and information provided by the plaques throughout the fort.  They have a guided tour at 11 AM that I sadly wasn't able to attend as I was there at park opening.  It's great to see a part of history and there's a nice view of the beach from the top of the fort.  When you arrive at the park the young lady at the hut lets you know that your admission is good for the entire day, and she kindly advised me to come back later in the evening to enjoy the sunset.  As I was driving home after my visit I wasn't able to take advantage of that, I did however give my admission ticket to the other party traveling with me for my business trip, and she took advantage of the beach, and sunset, and gave it 2 thumbs up.  Fort Zachary is a must if you're in Key West.

9/8/2019,"We visited Fort Zachary Taylor after being given a recommendation and were told that it was the beach the locals used. We drove there and paid an entrance fee  but also saw that everyone had to pay to enter,  whether on foot, bicycle or car The car park was easily signposted but the area to the ""beach"" was not so we just followed some people. We walked through what was like a clearing in a woods to the beach area, but to call this a beach was a bit much. There's no sand, just a stony area where we placed our towels and headed into the sea. The whole sea is covered in rocks,  lots and lots of rocks.  They're was so sandy bits at all.  When you were standing in the water,  you were balancing precariously on large rocks.  The water wasn't clear either, it was  quite murky.It wasn't that pleasant at all,  so much so we cut our visit short.My biggest gripe here are the bathroom facilities.  Considering they're charging every person an entrance fee,  I thought they would have excellent facilities.  However,  they were disgusting.They were filthy dirty with lots of stagnant water floating on the floors.  No attendant on duty. I only used them to get changed as they were far too dirty to use the facilities.Overall I was very disappointed in my visit here,  not at all what I was expecting ",Sharsmyth,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dublin,Dublin,Ireland,Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews

The fort has been wonderfully maintained/restored and there are lots of signs with info about the first through different periods of use.

Back in the middle of last century, the place was falling apart, and the Daughters of the Confederacy hadn't the funds to repair it, so they came up with a real clever idea: Tell the Florida Legislature that Judah Benjamin, treasurer for the Confederacy, stayed there at the conclusion of the Civil War as he evaded capture by the Union. The higher-ups bought it and bam, the place was renovated and it sits today as a Florida State Park.

12/30/2019,"The Gamble Plantation is authentic enough with the original foundation in the small mansion.  But virtually everything else has been burnt down or replaced including the furniture.  The sugar mill which provided revenue to the plantation is gone as are any of the other exterior buildings.  The solid ""tabby"" concrete walls in the main structure are nearly 2 feet thick and are original.  It was designed to try to keep the rooms cool in the Florida heat.  But the interior walls, ceilings, doors are floors are refinished.They took pains to furnish the rooms with authentic looking pieces from the era in this State Park.  But Robert Gamble had abandoned the plantation in bankruptcy after about 15 years and moved lock, stock and barrel back to Tallahassee where all of his furniture soon burnt up in a warehouse fire.Even the gift shop was devoid of souvenirs due to ""lack of state funding"" according to the woman behind the counter.  She couldn't be nicer and was apologetic about it.  The tour guide was extremely informative and had worked there over 10 years.  What I found most interesting were his fun facts about the origins of expressions like ""throw the baby out with the bath water"", ""sleep tight"" and ""hush puppies.""One visit at $6/person was more than enough.",Tony S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sarasota,Florida,United States,Gamble Plantation Historic State Parktripadvisorreviews

Although non of the furnishing are original, a great deal of care and money was spent to capture what it was like to live there in the mid 19th century.

We visited this park last Monday after seeing it on the TripAdvisor site.  The park ranger, Jessie, was the ticket seller, museum manager, and tour guide.  Our 'tour' was a very private affair as we were the only 2 visitors at this time (immediately after lunch break).  Jessie was very well informed, funny, and a great story teller.  We learned a great deal about the history of the plantation, the politics of the Civil War era into the early 1900's, and the Ellenton area. There is a small museum with displays and handouts which offer additional information.  This was a very pleasant and informative way to spend a few hours on a hot and sunny summer day.

He also had a very dry, entertaining sense of humor that accompanied the detailed information. You have a real sense of history and the struggles that were faced during that time period. Those who were slaves are recorded in memory in the museum. Interesting to see how people lived during that era, and we left with feeling we learned quite a bit about the civil war period and how people lived in the Florida heat during that time period.

The museum did give us some background that helped understand what we saw, ie. the huge cistern.It is worth the price (of $0) but I wouldn't consider it a major attraction unless you can take the tour.

Pet friendly but you can‚Äôt bring your dog on the beach in front of the park you have to go to the south or north end. The south end has a gate easy to get to the beach and our dog loved it.

They need to have a better system for people to cancel because there were several spots at this campground that went unused over the weekend which I‚Äôm sure other people would‚Äôve liked to use. Even though it said all spots were reserved online . The Rangers were very nice to check in and the bathrooms clean like the other reviews have said. I would definitely like to stay here longer to enjoy the beach and possibly bring a boat as there is a boat ramp here are the access to the intracoastal. The other campers were very friendly and had well behaved dogs. A bicycle would be good too because the sidewalks go north and south forever.

6/12/2019,"Stayed one night in an RV / SUV camping here in early June and it was great.  Very nice quiet beach with sand that has a course and orange / sandstone color hue to it.  Not very many shells or seaglass at all along this strech of the beach, but tons of little sand crabs and coquina shells that are fun to watch as they bury themselves in the sand when the waves retreat back into the ocean.  The oceanside camp site that we had was a little tight (south side sites on the ocean seem smaller than the sites on the north side) and close to the neighbors with no shade, but the location steps from the beach makes you forget about those negatives.  Very clean bathrooms, friendly rangers, and surprisingly little to no bugs at our oceanside site (it was a cloudy early June day with periods of rain and a bit breezy so not sure how the bugs are in other weather conditions).  This was a most pleasant surprise as we fully expected to have lots of no-see um bugs or mosquitoes but nope, the day and night were there they were a non issue.Easy walk to a good beachfront restaurant ( High Tides at Snack Jacks)  just north of the campsite.  The downtown Flagler beach area is a bit further north.  Quiet campsite even though you are between the beach and the road A1A the road noise is almost invisible and there is plenty of vegetation where you don't even see the road....and yes you hear the waves at night.  The beach next to the campground does not allow dogs but the city beach that is literally just as easy to get to by walking and close by just south of the campsites does allow dogs on the beach.

It is about a $6 car toll to get on the island over the bridge, and $2 for bicycles. This park is south of the Boca Grande town. There is an honor toll of a coule bucks to park if you come by car.  There is a picnic area under the trees with benches and I think I remember BBQs.  Beyond that is the beach & lighthouse museum. The museum is really interesting, and it shows the history of the island, the phosphate dock that was part of the port, sea shells, and marine life, and photos & maps. There is a donation you can give for entry to the museum.  There is also a cool gift shop. The beach is really nice.  It is wide with white sand and sometimes shells if the tide brings them to shore.  Across the Boca pass you can see Cayo Costa island.This pass has strong currents, so I suggest you swim a bit north as the beach wraps around the point.  This pass is known for the Tarpon fish which is prized in many tournaments, which are usually held in June & July. Gasparilla Island is old Florida at its best.

10/26/2019,"We came here two separate days. Getting here was pretty easy. We had a convertible and the roads here are perfect for cruising with the top down! The streets are tree lined on both sides and for the most part people don't seem to be in a hurry.  The sand is clean. The beach does have shells and so there is a little rough patch to step through before you get out into the soft sand when entering the ocean. The first day the waves were very calm but the second day the ocean was rough and it was windy. We saw seahorses, dolphins, lots of fish. The island is quaint and quiet while we were visiting. The lighthouse was pretty cool. There is a fee to visit and also to get on the island but that didn't bother us.

Go up past the County border markers to the bridges and look over the sides and you‚Äôll see gators relaxing in the stream. It‚Äôs a beautiful ride out in the countryside.

There is free admission for the beach this summer so it was a little busier then usual. The beach is within walking distance from the campsites but because of the extreme heat we had all week, we drove to the beach. Parking is minimal, so you have to get there early. Destin is a 25 minute drive without traffic. Seaside is about 10 minutes away, but it was so busy we couldn‚Äôt park and drove by it. Publix is about 15 minutes away and Walmart is about 20 minutes.

1/15/2020,"Recently had a 8-day visit; we cut it short by a day due to an approaching storm.  We were in the back section, which had recently gone through some renovations.  Our site was concrete while a number of others were gravel.  Important to know, depending on your rig and setup needs.  We were very close the bathhouse - there are two at this park and each is equipped with washer/dryers.  Our bathhouse was clean and everything was serviceable.  The park host was nearby and stopped on the first day and introduced himself and said if we needed anything to let him know.  When we parked, our picnic table was stuck back in the trees so we moved it out to the concrete pad, but then had to battle brush and low hanging limps to get to our fire ring.  It definitely wasn't convenient to use.  Short walk to the beautiful beach, which during our stay was never crowded.  Quite a number of nearby restaurants within an easy bike ride; if you brought bikes.  If you didn't and wanted to rent some, several nearby shops will actually delivery to your site.  The front gate staff were helpful and there are a number of trinket items advertising Grayton park to buy.  Ice and firewood are normally available, but during our stay firewood was never available.  However, a short drive down the road to Publix solved the problem.

This is a relatively small campground compared to some of the others in the area. Our campsite had good access to Western Lake which was nice for lake sitting as well as putting our kayak in. Our campsite was pretty level - we noticed on walking around that some were not. The surface is crushed stone. Each site has a picnic table, fire ring and clothes line. Most sites on the 1-39 loop are fairly private and have some shade. The bathroom/shower facilities are clean, an adequate number number for the size campground and centrally located in each loop. There is one washer and one dryer per loop. There is a white sand beach about half a mile from the campground and many asphalt bike trails in the area. Western Lake is great for kayak, canoe or SUP.

11/20/2019,"We always like stopping in this area on each Airstream Trip to Florida since it right at 200 miles away and a great place to get reacquainted with our trailer with plenty of supply nearby.The ""Emerald Coast"" is simply beautiful, which is clearly why so many people are moving here.  Gracious, the traffic on HW-98 from San Destin to Destin is just maddening with the road work going on.However, Grayton Beach is just 23 Miles East of Destin (read a 45 min drive, or more) and it's not as crowded, yet.  With the brand new HW 331 connecting I-10 to HW-98 less than 2 miles East of CR-283,  no doubt that will soon change.It's taken us nearly 4 years to make a reservation here so BOOK IT QUICK.The Campground is so well located and for now, remote.The kayaking here should be fantastic with a dedicated boat ramp with access to an inland lake know as ""Western Lake"" that is very close to the beach.This is probably THE MOST LEVEL camping spot we have ever been on.  I can't tell you how many devices I have to make my rig ""nearly level"" athwartships.  Attaining level fore and aft is easy but not so poret to starboard (left to right).  I carry two extremely accurate carpenter levels to achieve this goal of being level and as soon as we backed into position to hook up, we were spot on.This morning as we watched the campers next door depart, we saw a park worker literally arrive in less than 15 minutes after the previous camper left AND....Are you ready for this?He RAKED the gravel level to erase the tire marks and clear the pine needles.

5/21/2019,"We have been to Florida beaches and this one is one of the best.  It is well maintained by both Park Rangers and ""volunteer helpers.""  Plus the population in general is cognizant of the fragility of this wonderful natural resource and police themselves.  The beach is clean as a whistle.  There is plenty of parking available to handle trucks as well as cars and SUV's.This is definitely a family beach and everyone is respectful of each other.  There is no loud music blaring and if catch or other games are being played, wide birth is given to people on blankets sunbathing.  This beach will also accommodate surf casters and people on blow-up floats and kick boards. On the bay side of the beach, there is also accommodation for RV's and campers.If children are building sand castles, the sand is leveled before leaving so that turtles who are migrating to lay eggs will not fall in and be trapped.

Included picnic table and in-ground grill and much-used clothesline. The beach facilities were excellent and beach was pristine. It was too far to walk to the beach from the campsites, but not too far to ride a bike. The parking lot was large, so we would drive to the beach. Bath houses were in good shape although showers didn't have a good stream of water. This campground is so close to dining/shopping at Grayton Beach, Watercolor and Seaside! One word of caution, when you arrive, the barricade that opens up for you is on a timer and not motion detection. When we got there, it crashed down on our pick up that we were towing. Fortunately it only scratched the headlight, but the board broke in the process. The staff there told us that it happens often. WHAT?!?!

I think they should charge a few more dollars to keep some of the ppl out who will easily pay the $6 but leave their trash laying around.  Also perhaps charging a few more dollars then they could make some improvements to the bathhouse and add a shower or two.  I would like to see some lifeguard stands too - I saw a couple park rangers running up and down once or twice during our 3+hour stay but not really anyone life guarding.

6/8/2020,"So, we stayed at the Emerald Grande. This condominium does not have a walk out with beach access since it is on the Destin harbor. We looked on Google earth for public beaches.  While there are some, many do not have a lot of parking and showers were not a guarantee. Across from Destin Walmart, is Henderson Beach State Park. If you‚Äôre a camper, there are places to do that.  From the entrance, it is very wooded and full of dunes. You drive the paved road to be a little building, were you pay six dollars for two people or more‚Ä¶ Just per carload. It is four dollars if you are by yourself. We were in Destin six days and went to Henderson every single day. It is a much lower key beach experience in the public beaches. There are less people, there‚Äôs more room to spread out, bathrooms, showers, and pavilions. Although a few miles from our condo, we almost felt like it was the best kept beach secret.

3/24/2019,This is definitely place they hit when Destin  other beaches are busy. Reason for this I believe there's no drinking allowed on the beach.. State Park employees are there to keep an eye on people. If you come in the sand dunes set up a little bit higher as so does the walkway and you can see dolphins swimming out about a hundred yards.

Lots of signage making you aware of current water conditions.  The park ranger who took our $6 payment was kind and informative.  There is no lifeguard on duty so swim at your own risk. Thankfully a team of sheriffs officers were in the parking lot the day we were there.  Once alerted, they risked their lives to save someone who was swimming despite the red flag warnings.

Being a state park they were very good about following the rules on how many vehicles were allowed to enter and they run a nice, clean park. AT least when we were there. Our suggestion on the entry fee, Bring exact change if you can. They had a cash-only line and it was much faster.

12/22/2020,"What a place!  My family of 8 (6 adults and 2 children) went for a weekend camping trip.  We booked two sites (15 and 16) for three tents. As other have said the campsites are close to each other.  This was our first trip and site 15 for tents only was a perfect site to offer a little more elbow rooms.  It is a corner with a large tree that allows for separation and amble space for set up.  We also had site 16 which is good and flat on one side but bumpy with lots of tree roots on the other.  For three tents it worked out perfectly between the two sites.  After walking around the full campground, I might opt for sites 40 - 45 on a back circle for just a little more privacy.The grounds are wonderful.  Campsites are well maintained and have a mix of families, singles and several small groups of friends.  Bathrooms are well maintained and easy to access.The trails are wonderful.  Beautiful scenery, well maintained and easy to walk.  The camp store is well equipped but runs out of wood fast.  Be sure to bring some of your own if camping on a cold night.

We agree!The ""picnic area"", while it had pavillions, tables out in the open and grills was not in a ""scenic"" area to our liking.  We took our chairs and cooler onto the boardwalk and staked out in one of the bench areas the extend beyond the actual walking area.  Had a much nicer swamp experience that way.If you are visiting or just traveling through the area, you really should experience this park.

Several of these inter-twine, so it is helpful to get a map as you pay your entry fee so that you can determine which way you want to go. An advantage in hotter weather is that many of these are well shaded. There is another area where there are bike paths that can also be walked on - these do not have as much shade. A special feature not to be missed is the CCC Museum, which has a wonderful collection of artifacts and pictures of the CCC in action. Very knowledgeable staff bring this era to life.We spent over 4 hours here, and saw less than half of what there was to see.

(The area across from my site was just a jumble of campers.)There was some scrub brush less than 3 feet deep on each side of my narrow site that did nothing for privacy.  We did not use the picnic table, but if I had, I could have reached out and touched the RV next to us.The fire ring was in a very bad location and appeared like it had not been used for a long time.  It was at the end of the site VERY close to the parking space for the neighboring site.The power/water pedestal was on the right side of my camper.

The site was a nice size and the facilities were just what we needed.     They have washer/dryer, showers, main office with a store (try their sour orange ice cream it‚Äôs delicious!), an outdoor sink, and tons of trails.      They have a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Museum where you can learn about how the park was made/maintained.  The married couple in the museum was the nicest and most friendly people when we came in.  Our kids loved it.

10/22/2019,"The drive into the park is simply beautiful! Giant oaks and the tallest sabal palms we've ever seen formed a canopy over the road, shading it from hot sun. We were snapping pictures even before we hit the trails. After a storm brought rain all night and half the morning, we were afraid the trails might be too wet to walk, but happily, we had no trouble at all. All four trails we walked, even the sandy ones, were fine and not muddy. We started with a visit to the museum, which holds the history of the construction of the park by the CCC during the 1930s. The museum also has restrooms. Then we hit the trails. The cypress swamp trail confused us. Part way into the trail, the boardwalk turned from a wide, sturdy construction with tall handrails on each side to a narrow, two-foot-wide walk with a very low rail on only one side. What rationale prompted this? We turned around and came back, preferring that to becoming alligator food. The other trails were beautiful. We took pictures of moss, fungus, flowers, trees, and ferns, and enjoyed the beauty of nature. We saw very few other hikers so it was a calm, peaceful day.",88Tropicsfan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,North Port,Florida,United States,Highlands Hammock State Parktripadvisorreviews

2/20/2020,"Without a doubt, this was the worst Florida State Park we have every visited.  The campground was like a Wal-Mart parking lot, with RVs on top of each other.  We were in a tent and had absolutely no privacy.  Many of the RVers must come yearly and knew each other, and their conversations were loud and distracting. People were too lazy to stay on the road when walking between campsites and just cut across our tent area.  The trails were very short and pretty much devoid of wildlife. The $10 tram ride was good and took us to places on the property that we would not have gotten to, and there were alligators, turtles and birds in those areas that are basically off-limits to visitors.

1/30/2021,"This is a large State Park with many amenities (most were not available during our stay).  We stayed in the oldest loop, and found the heavily treed  sites to be mostly level with convenient hookups (water and electric) that functioned properly. Unfortunately the dirt sites do not seem to drain well after even a little rain so the dirt turns to mud and with the shade does not dry out easily.  Some sites were more private than others - most were not that private at all.  The bath house was clean, but clearly had seen better days.  The water was hot with good pressure, but the showers were just okay.  The staff indicated to me this will be replaced with a new bath house in the future.  The multiple speed bumps through out the park were annoying.",VillagerRick,3.0 of 5 bubbles,The Villages,Florida,United States,Hillsborough River State Parktripadvisorreviews

Our site was very easy to set up on, but it apparently hadn't been spruced up between visitors in a while.  The firepit wasn't cleared out and we picked up quite a bit of small litter.  The men's room also wasn't restocked with TP when it was just cleaned.  The river trail is balm for the spirit and the Baynard Trail offered a very nice and easy walk through the woods.

6/6/2020,"We have been to this state park several times, it‚Äôs a great park with lots of trails and amenities. Rentals, cafe, pool, fishing and hiking. However this was our first time camping here. We were rather disappointed. Arrival check in was easy and quick. Campsites are not very private, which we prefer. Our site ended up being quite sloped. With a pop up camper we were unable to level it properly and had to move it several times to find a flatter spot. Setup here took 3x longer then normal. Their sites are not well maintained compared to places we been(all being state parks). Very sandy and sinks easily. Fire pit still have coals and trash in it. Picnic tables needed power washed. We seen lots of staff out walking and driving carts around yet bathroom toilet paper was empty, dog bag stations empty. Bathrooms not well cleaned. Seen a lady staff member go inside bathroom with spray bottle. She did not wipe anything down, only sprayed and left. When it needed a clean and restock. They had a display out showing recyclable items, but several pieces had came off and needed reglued. Little things like this would be an easy fix and make things seem much more maintained. One of the bridges were damaged by Irma, yet it doesn‚Äôt seem they plan to fix it anytime soon. Issue is this makes trying to access trails more difficult. All the roads within the campground are terrible! Very rough broken up road with potholes. Very much needs fixed. We like to take walks around the campground and with a stroller it made it very difficult. Pool and cafe were closed, so unable to speak about those. We do love a lot of the trails, very nice rapids area great for pictures and watching. It‚Äôs a beautiful place nature wise, just wish things were better maintained here. By far the worst campground we have visited. I can not recommend camping here!",icemodeled,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Florida City,Florida,United States,Hillsborough River State Parktripadvisorreviews

10/16/2019,"I went canoeing with my son and two grand children (15 and 10) on a beautiful, quiet and cool morning.  The river was like glass with almost a non-observable current.  We rented two canoes for two hours at $25 per canoe (plus $6.00 for park entree per car).  Two hours is more than enough to paddle down the river to the boundary of the park and back.  Most of the trip is in shade with beautiful canopy of trees.  We didn't see many birds and only one alligator this trip.  The canoes are located right next to the water and an attendant helped us get them in and out of the river.  Everyone had a great time.  We didn't fish, but there were many canoes and kayaks on the water fishing for bass and I assume catfish (which we saw in clear stretches of the river).",FloridaSunDevil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,West Palm Beach,Florida,United States,Hillsborough River State Parktripadvisorreviews

Although you can fit a large camper/motor home in , it really isn't to big rig friendly.

The rapids have been closed since 2019. 3. The entire campground is a water table, so it stays extremely wet. 4. Not only is the stationary bridge closed (and has been since Irma!!) so are the two big trails: Bayard and the Wetlands. There is No Privacy between sites and I was shocked at the number of people having to be in sites that were almost under water. 5. The site mentions the cafe is closed - that means the pool is closed, the canoe and kayak rentals are closed and besides the one 1.1 mile hiking loop and there is absolutely nothing to do.",SandraMu,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Fort Worth,Texas,United States,Hillsborough River State Parktripadvisorreviews

First the nature trail was relaxing and enjoyable. Baby eagles etc... a nice 1.5h walk. North beach was packed, Oasis beach was rocky, packed, victim of storms and maybe spotty maintenance. Main beach was packed and what I did not like was it was not raked as mounds of seaweed and sand flees covered the beach.

They advised on three or four walking routes, varying in length and terrain,  they even told us what to look out for and where we may see the best wildlife. Owl, bald eagle, armadillo and lots of hungry ospreys. The tide was not best suited for the five mile around the point but we still got a good way around without getting wet feet.

It is so tranquil! You can find a good spot that feels like you are alone in paradise!  Maybe under a sea grapes tree that is right on the water and with many different birds coming and going! And butterflies all around! There are  2 seater swings, picnic tables, a few cafes and for rock hounds this is the place!  There are lots of rocks and sea shells!  I have found all beaches to be hit or miss with lots of sea shells!  Every time you go it is different!  This is my new favorite beach! You have to pay 8$ for a carload but it is well worth it!

7/16/2020,"We live in Orlando, and have access to many spectacular beaches. We decided to get away for a few days from all the lockdowns and quarantines. We chose this beach because it was close to our AirBnB and Holy Cow! I wish I would have read some reviews first! We set up our chairs and umbrellas on the super narrow beach, and ran to the water to cool off! Everyone started screaming and crying in pain! There were huge sharps rocks EVERYWHERE! You literally had to lay on your stomach and slide over the rocks to get to deeper water, were you still would gash your feet. My entire family was cut up and bleeding. Afterwards, we laughed it off, but the next day you better believe we went to a different beach!Other honorable mentions: the beach is super narrow, so people had to walk through our set up just to get down the beach. I'm talking about ten yards at the widest point! We're a pretty friendly bunch, so we took this opportunity to meet new people, but when you're in the water away from your belongings, people are walking all through your chairs and blankets.If you're still here, hang on for the worst part! There are many MANY jet ski rental places all around. Approximately 728 people had jet skis riding them just beyond where people swim. The noise was INCREDIBLE! And the smell of gasoline and exhaust is overwhelming! Now, I understand there are quieter, more secluded areas around this island, but if you park anywhere near the pavilions (around Cafe Honeymoon & South Beach Pavilion Cafe) this WILL BE your experience! Now excuse me, I still have cuts on my knee I need to attend to! Good Luck!",Strother1106,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Orlando,Florida,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

9/14/2019,"The park has changed as years for the worst. Don‚Äôt mind a leash law on shore. But let‚Äôs get real when you dog is in the water swimming does he need the leash or playing fetch. I really thought that is the things we do with a dog at the beach in the water. The park Rangers will find you 80.00 for your dog swimming in the water off leash. They have allowed boats to pull up to the shoreline and put anchors in the sand. Very dangerous to step on when swimming. They tell us dog beach is not s swimming areaPeople come to dog beach without dogs and complain. The boaters get off the boats with paying to enter the park and put up umbrellas , chairs , drink alcohol and rangers don‚Äôt say nothing. Even though it‚Äôs against the park rules. But we as dog owners cant play in the water or swim with our dogs without being tied down . I understand for the leash law on land is a good idea due to the closeness of people and other dogs. Not off shore.. I haven‚Äôt renewed my pass this year. Been pass owner for 20 years only go once a week at that. The park will like all the dog people to leave and welcome all boaters that don‚Äôt pay.  Maybe the park won‚Äôt need so many employees.

5/30/2019,"It had been about 8-10 years since my wife and I visited the North Beach of the Island so on a nice May afternoon we went to see what had changed. The first thing you encounter is that irt cost $8.00 per vehicle  for the two of us and there was no discount for being a Florida resident or being seniors. The price had increased several dollars from our previous visit.Next I looked for the gray building which sat at the most Northern parking area of North Beach. It was no longer there much to my surprise. Neither were there any picnic tables in sight nor any swing sets that I remembered. The character of the North Beach has changed to more of a young persons fun in the sun and more protected with breakwater stone barriers running parallel to the shore versus vertical from the shore although some vertical barriers remained I thought that this was an improvement from a swimming and safety point of view.Disappointing to us was the lack of any benches ( except one bench apparently given in memory to a nice gentleman) to just rest and enjoy the scenery. That was in sharp contrast to the numerous benches along the Dunedin Causeway. The beach was active with a lot of young people with their own chairs and various sun shade tents and umbrellas. We did not see many older people on the beach and no one was shelling which was something we enjoyed doing on previous visits We stopped at the cafe before leaving and found the prices were on the exorbitant side for seniors on a fixed income. We noted that the deck has seen better days and has weathered to the point it needs to be replaced. The Department of Enviromental Protection needs to take a better look at this facility and the competitiveness of the food and merchandise for sale. If you go I suggest you bring your own food , plenty of water , sunscreen, beach chairs and a means to be in the shade . I sense that the park is now more set up to serve young families and teenagers tthan it was several years ago.",Ralph R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Palm Harbor,Florida,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/26/2019,"We aren't big beach people. I don't like the crowds, the wind, the schlepping and the sand that gets into everything. We had seen Clearwater and the other ""top"" TripAdvisor beaches on the St. Petersburg Peninsula and didn't like what we saw. Way too commercial, way too big way too much hassle.Nonetheless, we both put on swim suits and packed a change of clothing for our visit to Honeymoon Island just in case.I'm so glad we did. Honeymoon Island's beaches are broken up into nice-sized areas with excellent parking access, changing rooms, showers and bathrooms. The beaches are white sand and the water is pale turquoise with good visibility. There are artificial reefs to demarcate the swimming area from the power boating areas.We were there Memorial Day weekend and the shallows were like bathwater. The deeper you go the cooler the water. The air temperature was in the low 90's but, in the water, it felt great. Because of the trade winds, even the beach didn't seem too hot.We didn't bring chairs or beach umbrellas and were sorry we didn't. It would have been nice to hang out on the beach and read a trashy novel or just soak in the scene.We showered and changed and then headed off to the Cafe Honeymoon for ice cream to get the taste of salt out of our mouths.This is our kind of beach.",Scott B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,St. Petersburg,Florida,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/25/2019,"What a beautiful day with the family. Honeymoon Island takes a little wait to get into (the $8 per car they charge slows down traffic a bit). But once in - parking is plentiful. VERY plentiful. We arrived at 10:30am and we had our pick of spaces. I kept checking throughout the day and there was always a space available. Bring water shoes. We were at Main Beach and the beach itself is white powder. However, step into the water and it‚Äôs all rocks for about 50 feet until you get back into soft white sand. There is a sand bar and the water is extremely shallow. You can walk pretty far until the water gets deep enough to get up to your waist. This is literally the perfect beach for families with small children - as long as they have water shoes. The cafe isn‚Äôt just your run of the mill beach fare. Yes, they had chicken fingers. But they also had a grilled chicken salad called a ‚ÄúParadise Salad‚Äù with mandarin oranges and strawberries - incredible. The view from the cafe reminded me of a restaurant overlooking the Carribbean - deep blues and green of the water in the background. The changing rooms are nice and big. No wait for either the changing rooms or the bathrooms. Wonderful day with the fam. ",Michele B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Lakeland,Florida,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/10/2019,"It‚Äôs been awhile since we enjoyed the lovely, postcard perfect shores of the Gulf of Mexico (most anywhere) along the Florida coast. One of our favorites spots to dip our toes is Honeymoon Island State Park in Dunedin. We had originally planned to spend more than an hour or two and do some swimming and laying out. Plans changed‚Ä¶ but we still went and so happy we did! This is a small island with a beach. One lane in, one land out. Locals head out on the weekend, so plan accordingly. The state beach is out at the end, so you may be sitting in a line. This is a major favorite with locals, so weekends are very, very busy. Plan ahead. The crowds and line... they are the ‚Äúbut...‚Äù we have for this spot. You will pay, so check ahead for latest pricing and updates on their website. The park itself is rather large, with a few, large parking lots, a couple cafes (think beach food under a roof), and bathrooms. There is a dog beach nearest the front end, and lots of places great for kids and families. We head to the furthest area, park, then walk. We think there was some hurricane damage (based on our previous visit and what we were seeing, the beach appears smaller now). But that doesn‚Äôt diminish from what‚Äôs available. There are many places to enjoy this lovely Gulf front setting. At the time of our visit there was A LOT of washed up sea grass and such, a storm having passed through two days before. This limited greatly access to the water along the main beach areas. Locals didn‚Äôt mind the lack of entry nor the smell; we could have skipped both. We do love the walking out here, so we passed everyone settling in. We‚Äôre assuming park staff shoveled out the narrow pathways into the surf every hundred yards or so. But folks hardly seemed to notice; plenty of blankets, towels, and umbrellas were everywhere. Beyond the crowds the white sand was less and less covered, the surf soon easy to enter, the colors post card perfect. The crowds dropping off, with far fewer kids, we moved to the areas of more wild and natural beach. But this is a walk in the sand, a workout, so plan accordingly. The sand is white and powdery out here, but there are many hidden obstacles underneath - I stepped on more than my fair share and felt it. But out here there are beautiful sights others miss further in. Shelling varies as it always does, but it‚Äôs less picked over (if you get there early enough), and fishermen and women are enjoying the further out area, until the line of people grows; then they stream out as visitors stream in. We walked over a mile before we turned to head back and picked a spot on a larger ‚Äúbluff‚Äù overlooking the ‚Äúriver‚Äù behind us and the gulf in front. Here we had 360 views of water, fish jumping, and even a passing dolphin. Honeymoon Island has been attracting visitors for years, and is a popular weekend spot for locals. But it‚Äôs also a great spot for visitors and if you want to enjoy one of the most beautiful parts of Florida - the beach - it‚Äôs among the top choices. But remember, it is VERY popular and especially on the weekend, you will feel the crowds, unless you‚Äôre willing to walk a bit. And that line of cars on the way in... only grows...Bathrooms are available at the buildings. We didn‚Äôt go searching, but there appeared to be a ramp on one building for handicap access. The second floor bathrooms (women‚Äôs side) offers toilets, dressing areas, and privacy. This is well done and beyond ‚Äúprimitive,‚Äù but it is still a park beach offering; its functional, but don‚Äôt think luxury. You can find items for sale in a couple small shops, mainly for beach eating and activities. I saw a sign that indicated you can even buy a packaged meal kit for BBQing. Also saw a location to rent bikes. And there appeared to be places to launch kayaks as well as biking.",Zak Paul,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Orlando,Florida,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

7/3/2020,"i have been waiting a very long time to come to this island.  super beautiful white sand beaches and beautiful water......but -- the beaches, inside and outside the water, are full of sharp shells and rocks for a good 20 yards into the water as you try reaching your goal of the sandbar.  you have to get past these stinkers until you reach the sand bar where it is shell and rock free.  had i known that i would have had my 3 teens wear water shoes.  we left honeymoon island full of bleeding toes and scraped legs.  from what i learned,  the beach we were at used to be pretty free of the rocks until hurricane Irma came and shifted all of those rocks onto shore.   the hurricane changed the entire environment physically.  since honeymoon island is a nature preserve, a natural environment, the rocks and sea weed are pretty much what you have to deal with if you want to enjoy everything else.  we paid $29.00 for an umbrella and 2 recliners (totally worth it LOL).  the beach attendant Brian was the perfect host, providing us alot of information having been there for our first time.   we accidentally ran out of sunscreen and Brian GAVE US HIS lol  omg!  No one is nice and kind like that anymore.  it really made our day cause i'm super faired skinned and no sunscreen would have meant my death LOL.  Thank you Brian!  Next time  I would make more time for a bike or kayak rental.  Possibly even take the ferry over to Caladesi.  Not sure caladesi has any rocks or not  but it would be great to know!  Super Important Note:  We were there for the entire day.  About 2 hours in, i took a walk down the beach.  I  found a nice clearing in the sand from the beach all the way out to the sand bar with ZERO ROCKS.  it's located about the 3rd stairwell up from the first cafe/bathrooms BEFORE you hit the next building/cafe/gift shop.  once we discovered that clearing in the water, i couldnt get the girls off the sand bar!!!  advice:  bring your water shoes, lots of water, sunscreen, and a floatation toy of some kind.   This time of year the sting rays we were told are out on the sandbar so you have to scoot your feet instead of walk.  we didnt see any sting rays but our beach neighbors saw manatee and we saw jumping fish in the water.  2nd super important note:  the seagulls on this beach are vicious tag-teamers when it comes to stealing your food.  we were opening our jimmy johns sandwich and a large group of them flew onto my daughter and stole the sandwich right on her person.  it was terrifying (although now we laugh LOL ....think of the basement scene in home alone 2 where he screams like a girl....)",kimhamamoto,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Atlanta,Georgia,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

9/7/2019,"Ate at the little food cafe in the state park,  on the deck. Great beach views,, the food is awful and not worth the price.  Sides are extra,  the 3 chicken fingers don't come with fries, so you pay for fries separately The 3 ch82cjen fingers were heavily breaded and over cooked hard, dry and crunchy, had to peel off the breading to eat the chicken inside it,  almost inedible. Fries were good. Cheese burger was decent.  Order of fries were $4.25. Burger was $10.00, had to buy fries separately.  Altogether  for one burger, one order chicken fingers, two orders of fries, a water, and one beer, total came to $35.85. Definitely not worth it. The park itself is beautiful.

We decided to try this place and were very happy we did.  We did a mile on the beach then the 1.5 regular nature hike.  The Osprey Hike is excellent because it ends at a huge Bald Eagle's Nest.  We saw it flying around earlier on our hike but it wasn't there when we arrived.  We also saw many types of birds including huge Ospreys and a Gopher Tourtoise.  The hike is great for all levels because it has many cut offs, some benches and a trail on the sand if you want a real challenge.  The rest of the park has all kinds of fun things to do and id very clean.  The changing huts, the picnic area, the wooden swing areas all very clean.  Has some nice doggie areas too and areas to ride a bike.  The one thing is the beach is on the narrow side and many areas are rocky.  Thus I recommend wearing sturdy footwear on the beach.

When we walked down to the beach on the northern side were were shocked! The beach was gone. Only thing left was rocks and compacted sand. We walked towards Oasis Beach turned around and walked south to the Dog Beach. Was horrible. Beaches up in Massachusetts would put this (once beautiful) beach to shame. Can't believe Florida is allowing this beach to fall apart or at least not worn would be beachgoers (If you don't enjoy walking on, swimming out cutting your hands and feet on shark rocks) stay away. And then there were the fire ants that were all over the area we already settled on. There was no beach front distance either not sure if due to the harvest moon but when you walked up or down the beach you had to walk around people because there was no beach. So needless to say we won't be going back unless there are some major renovations. Did enjoy watching the pelicans dive bomb into the water catching lunch.

The wildlife is abundant.  Even rescued a wayward tortoise from the main road who thought my car was a nice shady spot to rest.  Many water birds to observe.  But of course, this place is known for it's many beaches.  They even have a beach for dogs.  There are a couple of pavilions that have bathrooms and/or serve food.  The water is very clear and refreshing.  The main beach was just gorgeous along with the other beaches that connect to it.  The parking was easy to find a spot and close to the beach for each beach I visited.There are some who complain about the $8 per vehicle fee, but do consider that if you go to Clearwater Beach or the other beaches around that area, you will spend way more than $8 to park...if your lucky to find any parking at all.  Here at Honeymoon Island, you can do so much more at this State Park then just hangout at the beach.    I will definitely be back at Honeymoon Island and will even catch the ferry to Caladesi Island next time around.  Yes, there is a ferry that will take you to Caladesi.

9/23/2019,"The causeway connecting the island to the mainland opened our eyes to a beautiful scene. The causeway was a busy place with people swimming, sunbathing ,cycling, walking, and using non motorized water craft. This area is not part of the State Park. So we wondered why do we want to pay $8 for the car to enter the State Park. After we passed through the dates, we visited the Nature Center and quickly began to understand there was more to see and do. Lots of history including the Tocobaga indigenous residents before Europeans arrived, the story of the hurricane which splt this island off of Caldeesi Island, etc. The Osprey and Pelican trails took us through slash pine forest and along mangrove forest. Quite a few birds were coming back to the area for winter and a variety of vegetation made for a good nature walk. There is also a family playground and plenty of picnic tables.

It's everything you want in a beach....nice, soft sand, water  that's clear, rentable beach chairs and umbrellas ($25 per day). All that being said...I liked Sand Key Park better. Honeymoon beach is quite narrow (yes...tides affect that but still narrow). Sand Key beach is huge! You don't feel like you are on top of everyone else. Facilities are fine at Sand Key...they have a food truck that has tables with umbrellas to dine under. They have an icee truck. And the bathroom facility, though a much longer walk than Honeymoon, seemed fine (we didn't visit them). Sand is a bit rougher and packed, which actually made it a lot easier to walk on (not at all like East Coast beaches!).Anyway, Honeymoon is quite nice but I'd opt for Sand Key again the next time I'm in the area.",Paul R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Kingston,New York,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews
6/24/2019,"It was a beautiful day, and I was honestly expecting the beach to be crowded. But once you go down the road to enter the park and pay the $8 fee, the amount of people at the beach drastically reduce. We went to the main beach; the waters were shallow, and perfect for kids. We went here during sunset and and although drones are not allowed, I recommend setting up your phone/GoPro etc. to capture a hypelapse of the sunset. Couple that with a couple of beach chairs, some snacks/light dinner and drinks, music, and it'll make for a great evening. We were in the Tampa area for barely a weekend, and we had but one day to do something fun and relaxing. We have no regrets about going to to this beach to spend the entire evening.

10/9/2019,"We read the reviews online and traveled one day of our vacation to Honeymoon Island State Park.  Disappointed is the first word that comes to mind when writing this review.  We had not been inside the park gate when we encountered signs which said ""beware of rattlesnakes""...shocking! Then, right before our eyes crossing the road was a large snake.  None of the reviews I read online said there were snakes running around the park.   Parking was a struggle as the ends of the rows are closed off so you have to turn around while attempted to find parking. We had our dog with us and attempted to go to the ""dog beach"".  It was not a beach at all.  It was a bunch of hard crushed up shells and rocks and our dog could not even walk and ended up cutting his paw.  You also cannot take your pet off a leash.  Just to check out if it was any better, my husband kept our dog in the vehicle with the air running while I walked to the human beach....disappointed at it as well.  We literally drove a good distance and paid admission to stay in this park for about 20 minutes tops. I am a huge photographer and I made 1 photograph while there....of the entry sign.  :(   If you have a choice, I do highly recommend Fort DeSoto State Park.  The facilities there put this park to shame.  The dog beach is actually a beach and so is the human beach.  The facilities at Fort DeSoto are amazing!

There is a dog park part of the beach where dogs are allowed as long as you have them on a leash. I was nervous at first because the big dogs can be intimidating to the small dogs, but all the other dog owners were being responsible. I can see how it could be unpleasant if an owner wasn‚Äôt following the rules or paying attention to their dog. I‚Äôm glad that we had a positive experience.

8/10/2019,"Hubby and I were here to attend his nieces wedding. It was an absolutely gorgeous day and a beautiful ceremony. I highly recommend this place for a small intimate wedding. There were 40 of us including the wedding party and it was very nice, romantic and intimate. The weather was very warm but gorgeous and sunny. The ceremony was 630pm and we had a great breeze off the ocean. I especially liked that the entire wedding party and guests removed their shoes and walked on the sand in bare feet in their attire, gorgeous gowns and suits.  It really added to the ambiance of the day. It was just the right amount of people without anyone feeling overwhelmed and it made the atmosphere that much more romantic. I also liked that the bar was outside of the covered pavilion but only a few steps away which have gave everyone more space to mingle inside. After the ceremony and pictures on the beach, everyone moved inside the open air pavilion.  Although it didn‚Äôt rain, if it had we were covered. The staff did a great job with everything. The food was delicious.  Congrats to the happy couple. It went extremely well.  I wish I had known about this place when I got married. Tip - if you plan to have a wedding here, keep in mind Honeymoon Island State Park goes a long way, and several of its beaches have different names.  This wedding was held at the south pavilion. All guests would have to enter a secured gate before arriving at the beaches and pavilions. Her wedding guests drove their own vehicles or ordered lyft/uber, however I would suggest hiring a shuttle/van service to bring guests to the wedding that are not renting cars or ordering a rideshare. Overall it was a beatific event in a gorgeous setting. ",louise71594,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

Lots of people bank fishing along the causeway before the island. $4.00 for me to get in by car solo. Noted very quickly a sign that informed that rattlesnakes were common. Consequently, I didn't go chasing after wildlife to get pics. Did take a pic of a tortoise by the road. Well camouflaged in the brown grass. I got there at high tide so did not find any great shells, but collected a small handful of pretty small ones. Make sure you only take shells that are not actively being lived in. Even with water shoes, the area I waded into was Rocky under the surf. So I think I chose poor spot for swimming. I would like to check out the nature areas better next time.

1/1/2020,"We were surprised at just how many rocks and shells were on most of the beaches, but it is natural and pretty - just not like most of the photos we had seen. I will say that the nature preservation made us feel more appreciative of the non-commercialization.Once we found the area along the southern beach with more sand (just north of the dog beach), we took our shoes off to walk. The sand was the soft, fine grain typical of the gulf coast. It was accompanied by lots of sea grass and wood, but it was welcome and not an annoyance. We really enjoyed our time by the water. We parked at the southernmost (left) part of the Main Beach parking by the cafe. We even saw dolphins close to shore and lots of birds. There were maybe 100 cars total parked in all the lots and it was not very crowded, which was nice.My main comment isn‚Äôt applicable to all, but it sadly isn‚Äôt very positive: the cafe along the beach (two locations) needs some improvements to help keep the island current and living up to its name. We visited the southern-most cafe. It could be a nice addition if it were more on-brand with the romantic idea of ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù; instead, the inside felt like a dated, cramped convenience store kitchen. The employees were nice, but the food was bland and served in paper baskets on red trays. There were no windows to see out and there was no decor - just paper menu posters and letter board menus on the walls. There was an area with Honeymoon Island souvenirs and merchandise for sale, but it was difficult to access because it was in the corner on the opposite side of the line to order, and the items were chintzy. The outdoor patio was nice and breezy, but very large for the amount of people there. I think they could stand to take away some of the outdoor eating space to expand the indoor standing/ordering area. Hopefully they‚Äôll modernize it and up the quality a little soon because it does take away from the experience. It wasn‚Äôt terrible by any means, but seemed very out of place...it took our excitement and fondness down several levels.Just enjoy the nature and relax, and unless you‚Äôre starving, you may want to skip the cafe.",bf30121,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Johnson City,Tennessee,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

Yesterday we visited to walk the beach and take sunset photos, and today we went to ride bikes. There is a new bike trail which is very nice. I only wish it were longer or a loop. If you do the whole thing out and back, it‚Äôs 2.5 miles. We just rode it a couple times and rode some of the paved roads too. This would be a very nice bike path for families.

The park entrance was very reasonable for the information and the beautiful white sandy beach. There was hardly a single person on the beach. The beach is small and narrow.

The gentleman working setting up the umbrellas and beach chairs was friendly, and seemed very engaging with the folks who rented them. He also was setting up for a wedding that was happening that afternoon. Seemed like a great place to have a wedding!There was a little restaurant on site that seemed to have some great options for food and drink. We went with 6 kids under the age of 7 and had a blast for 4 hours. When we first got there it was too cold for the beach, so we went into Dunedin to the farmers market and killed some time there. Great little slice of beachy heaven here. Will be back next time we're in the Tampa area visiting family.",Seth L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Appleton,Wisconsin,United States,Honeymoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

7/5/2019,"I went on the 4th of July and as many reading this may know, the beach is very narrow at high tide - maybe 25‚Äô wide. There was a storm threatening shortly after I arrived and essentially all but 3 families cleared out - hence my ‚Äúprivate beech feel‚Äù title. I‚Äôll be honest, I was struggling to give the visit a 5 star rating but the presence of fire ants all over the beach (not swarms but I did get bit because they seemed to be all around the South end of the beach) made that difficult. Sitting in a beach chair and needing to check my feet constantly wasn‚Äôt as relaxing as it could have been. Otherwise, for me, $4 admission, plenty of parking, acceptable bath house / shelter, those were great! Looking forward to checking out the dog beach, but I don‚Äôt feel very excited about it being an ‚Äúon-the-leash‚Äù beach.

Something they charge for in Orlando where we were based! Excellent toilet and shower rooms, very clean. This place isn‚Äôt crowed like it‚Äôs neighbour Clearwater either. The shells you find along the beach are great and unique too. Lots of vehicle parking also.

It cost $8 per car to enter the park There are several beaches and a couple of stores for food and incidentals. One of the beaches is good for shell collectors another was better for swimming. The swimming beach had a few rocks, but you can easily get into the water which is relatively shallow near the beach. There were many fewer people here than at Clearwater Beach across the gulf.

1/26/2020,"We love camping in the rustic cabins on Hontoon Islands. So peaceful and great campsite. Cabins are rustic with minimal amenities but we love the screened in porch and fire pits with grills over top. Tips for campers: 1) buy firewood on the island rather than having to haul across on the ferry 2) try to make it their early and leave early or rent an extra day and stay late. Peak times make traveling across on the ferry, which only sits 6 people, take quite a while 3) Rent or bring your kayak and explore around the island. Great bird watching and might gets some alligators too! ",Garcialinette,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Davie,Florida,United States,Hontoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

I learned so much about the history of this State Park and you have to check out the museum! I have nothing but RAVE reviews to say about this place it just takes you back to a small town vibe.  We took advantage of the hiking trails, which were marked well, and the turkey and deer along the way just made it better. They have cabins you can stay and they have VERY clean bathrooms and HOT showers nearby...Oh and let's not forget the ferry boat that takes you across the river to grab a bite or just wander.

The island is a great getaway, with no car traffic other than the park ranger van that is used to help you get your belongings to/from the campsite. The cabins are rustic, with one room of bunk beds for all in your party, and no TV or A/C. However, after overcoming the initial shock, the kids had a great time getting back to nature. There are hiking trails, a kids playground, and canoes & kayaks to rent. Our cabin was directly under a hawk‚Äôs nest, with the birds calling for food most of the morning. On our hike we saw alligators, egrets, herons, and a pygmy rattlesnake. Time on the canoes added deer, turtle, and gar(fish) to the list.

1/2/2020,"We rented a cabin over Christmas Break and had a good time. Brought the grandkids and some games and fishing equipment and had some fun. The cabins are pretty ""rustic"", but comfortable, the park is beautiful, and the staff are all so helpful and friendly! It was cool that the park store has games you can borrow too. During our visit (last week of December) it was rainy, but we were lucky in that the rain was mostly overnight. The weather had been warm this fall, so the mosquitos were still pretty bad. (we were hoping for a December freeze to help with that!) We used our Thermacell repellent devices, and they were pretty effective. We didn't do a lot of hiking because everything was pretty wet, but the area by the office was nice, we walked up to the docks and went fishing and the kids played around on the playground. We were trying for a low-key trip to rest and rejuvenate, so we didn't go in search of any other activities, across the river. This park is so unique, it is definitely worth checking out even for a day trip. If you camp, the process is different than you might expect - you load your stuff onto wheelbarrows, come over on the ferry (free of charge), and then wheel your things to the loading area for the van. Then a ranger drives you and your stuff to the campground. When you are ready to head home you pack up, call for the van and reverse the process.",dboal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Gainesville,Georgia,United States,Hontoon Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

2/14/2020,"We went to the area where kayaks and canoes are stored. Stood and waited quite sometime finally asked the man in charge if we could rent a boat. He directs us to the gift shop says We cannot rent from him. I wish we would have been advised of that. We now walk back to the gift shop and the employee is on the phone talking about a job they are trying to fill. We finally go sit down while she continues to talk on the phone. She finally has time for us and we tell her we would like to rent a kayak. She then informs me I have to surrender my credit card for her to keep until we return the kayak. I explain that my credit card information had been compromised in the past, and the bank advised to never let someone take your card. She said that was their policy and that it was never going to change. This to me is a red flag for credit card fraud. The park itself is very nice. We rode bikes through the park.

I was NOT disappointed!  We paid $6 to get in the park. The lady at the booth was very nice and helpful.  We went to Park and Ocean and the guy helping us was awesome!  We rented two chairs and an umbrella for $20!  On Fort Lauderdale Beach, one chair was $18!  We walked through a tunnel under A1A right to the beach. A nice guy was there and set up our chairs and umbrella. I grabbed some chicken fingers from Park and Ocean for lunch. You can rent jet skis for the ocean. For the lake area, you can rent paddle boats, kayaks.  There are bikes for rent.  There are plenty of walking trails. We even got to see a big banyan tree.  This place is great!

We were staying north of Fort Lauderdale and had been looking for a place to walk in nature with a paved path for my wheelchair, and this was the spot!  There is a two mile paved loop where people bike, walk, and run.  We came in the entrance on Sunrise Boulevard (we had come by foot and in my wheelchair from the sidewalk along the ocean and didn't realize there was an entrance off A1A).  So we can in the main entrance for cars, and to the left towards the boat dock and water taxi area.  It felt very safe to stroll on the road even though cars use the road, too.  All the cars we saw were going very slow.  We saw a turtle in it's nest.  We walked along the road the flanks the intracostal waterway.  We wanted to do the whole loop but ran out of time.  We took the water taxi to get back to our car.  It's so cool you can access the park by the water taxi!I will definitely come back to this park if we go to the Fort Lauderdale area again.

I'm sure it would have been very pleasant had we had mosquito repellent. So, if you plan on walking in the wooded area here I highly recommend that you put some mosquito spray on.  Also something disappointing was that we saw people smoking inside the park. We saw a man smoking as he was entering the park and the park ranger did not say a word to him about it.

6/29/2019,"The peaceful scenery and the friendly staff were the first impressions when we arrived for an early morning floating experience. The atmosphere had a charming old-fashioned   feel and you nearly expected a troop of boy scouts showing up any moment, or maybe ""Baby"" from Dirty Dancing carrying a water melon. We got our floating devices and off we went to the water for a two-hour water experience. As the grandfather of the group I allowed myself to some kind of inflatable small boat instead of a tube in a futile effort to have something like a dry spot. Little did I know that I would spend 2 hours mostly sitting in a puddle of cold water in a difficult to control floating contraption.  It was fun nevertheless, the clean water, the nature, the absence of large crowds on this weekday morning made for an enjoyable experience, at least for the first hour or so. Then it got a little long and the cold water took its toll on my pleasure although I will admit that the rest of the group including my nine-year old granddaughter seemed to have fun until the very end.

It's off season right now so they have half the spring closed for tubing, but you are able to paddle up stream. The spring itself is clean and well maintained, so are the trails. There are two springs in the North Entrance which are beautiful. I could live my life here if they would allow me too.

The springs are beautiful. The water is initially very cold, but in a refreshing way. The water is calm and clear. Our tubing experience lasted about an hour and a half, and it was amazing. The spring is surrounded by trees and foliage. The spring lazily carries you down in your tube. We saw a small alligator, ibises, egrets, turtles, and fish. It was an incredible experience.

The river has gator warning signs posted. But lets get real we are in Florida a gator is an every day way of life. And we didnt see any. They are more scared of us than we are of them. We saw turtles of all sizes. And even a tortoise! I would recommend starting at the Blue hole. Their capacity is only 60 and fills up really fast and then go to the river to float.

When we left at 2:30 there was a line waiting to get in as space became available. 2. No need to rent from outside vender unless you aren‚Äôt very early to arrive. We arrived at 8, waited 5 min to get through gate, then 15 min for tube rental. The headrest tubes were really relaxing. Pay for team or walk one mile (25 min) to landing. 3. Bring a rope to hook your party together. So relaxing vs others who were trying not to get separated. Get a paddle when you pick up your tubes. You need one to push off of the trees and other obstacles along the way. We also had Bungie cords to tie our shoes to our tube. You can bring non-disposable water bottles but nothing disposable. 4. Bring a picnic lunch and waters. You‚Äôll want to head to car, eat and hydrate and then go again. You could easily spend all day here and there‚Äôs lots of room to hang out between floats. 5.

7/26/2020,"We visited on a Saturday in July. Although the north entrance is open, you can only swim in the head spring there. They told us tubing from the north entrance will most likely not reopen this season. This means everyone must tube from the south entrance (mid-point to take out.) There are definitely weekend crowds as a result. Here are my tips: 1) Rent tubes from an outside vendor. You will thank me once you see the line to rent in the park. We rented from Buffalo Joe‚Äôs and were the only ones there at 7:40. (You will pass several companies on your way.) Be in line at the park entrance before 8am. We were there at 7:50 and they were already letting cars enter. 3) Have the $6 entry fee in exact change. They are not offering cash change (maybe due to COVID??) and if you don‚Äôt have exact change, you will need to use the credit card line which moves slower. 4) We avoided the tram altogether by using the walking trails to the mid point and then back to the parking lot after the take out. They were about .5 mile each but you avoid all of the unmasked people in close quarters on the tram, and save the $5.50 per person fee. 5) I can‚Äôt stress enough to arrive early, especially if you go on a weekend. When we left at about 10:30, the park was already closed due to capacity. We debated doing another tube run, but the crowds were like Disney World once we got back to the parking lot and we decided against it. 6) We had a waterproof phone bag from past cruises that worked perfectly for our car keys.

10/21/2019,"What a serious amount of fun we have floating down the spring run! There are 3 choices for tubing, dependent on how much time you have. We prefer the Midpoint launch which is approx. 1 hour & 45 minutes. We hire our tubes, but you can bring your own. No food and drinks allowed, so make sure you‚Äôre hydrated before setting out. It is just beyond words been able to float around, and chill like this, surrounded by the beauty of nature.There is a shop at the South Gate where you can buy food. Prices looked reasonable. We prefer however to bring our own lunch, as we enjoy grilling in the park. And of course, while you‚Äôre there, take the drive up to the North Gate. There you will find the Ichetucknee Spring & Blue Hole Spring, which are just amazing to swim in. Careful on the stairs & rocks - they are quite slippery.

We chose the longest run and enjoyed it 3 times over the day. Float options are available. Open tubes keeping you wet and cool or if you prefer to stay dry, you can rent a raft or solid bottom tube. Prices are reasonable. Camping and cabins are available in the area for overnight lodging.

Both had great intermittent views of the springs and the river. I spotted a hawk, deer, and a snake along the Trestle Point Trail. In spite of the heat, the water created cooling breezes and shade is abundant. This was a great place to walk.

7/30/2019,"As a family, we love tubing on the many rivers and springs throughout Florida. This is one of the most remote, and kind of untouched river we've tubed on. The park itself gets crowded very quickly during the summer. There is limited parking, and it fills up quickly. Arrive early, or you may be waiting for a long time for your turn on the river. While I think it's over priced, do yourself a favor and purchase tickets for the tram/shuttle ride. Walking to the starting point of the river, and from the ending point back to the parking area is not much fun, especially during the summer. The coolness of the water is wasted if you try to save money and walk back. The river itself is really a nice tubing experience. Many of the rivers we go tubing on have houses on one or both sides of the river. This has none of that. Tubing down this river takes you back to old Florida, before too many people moved to the state. And if it weren't for the occasional loud, obnoxious visitor, it is a beautiful ride on the river and through the woods. If you forget to bring food, there is a snack shack available. I was surprised the food was pretty good. The service is slow, and there isn't a lot of room to sit, and it's a bit pricey, but the food and drinks will keep you going, especially if you have kids that get ""hangry"". Overall, we love tubing down the Ichetucknee. Get there early for parking, and so you can tube down the river at least twice.",Michael W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Port St. Lucie,Florida,United States,Ichetucknee Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

The north entrance allows only a certain amount of people and fills up fast. Make sure you bring a stick to push off the banks. Or an oar will come in handy. Bring bug spray. Have lunch at the south entrance (where you park your car) the walk is manageable but not necessarily fun because you have to bring your tube with you. After lunch (lots of picnic tables available) walk back down and get back in the water. When it's time to leave, do t bother with the shuttle, take the walk on the nature trail.

Only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the grass in water where you stand at the Blue Hole Spring, first spring was sand. They have nice bathrooms, water to wash feet, and food truck.

And when told the path to take there is a fork in the path and no sign pointing you to the ‚Äú rentals‚Äù . A couple of simple signs with the word ‚Äúrentals‚Äù and an arrow pointing in the direction would have saved a lot of unnecessary hiking , walking and unrest .

We were impressed with all of the activities Ichetucknee had to offer - tubing for a relaxing ride down the clear river, swimming and snorkeling at the head spring, snorkeling and diving at the Blue Hole. And there are just some of the activities.We ended up trying to swim into the cave at the Blue Hole - we were not prepared! We still had fun trying to battle the current to swim into the cave. We would recommend checking out the park's website before planning your visit. We were initially wanting to paddle down the river with our own paddleboards, but the time of year we visited the south take out was closed to vehicles so it would have been quite a hassle to use our own boards. The website will also help one determine what entrance to park at.If you are interested in more information about Ichetucknee Springs and other area springs visit our blog site in our profile.

There were plenty of people there swimming also and all seemed to be enjoying the cool water on a relatively hot day.  I think it would be a great place to paddle and think I may go back to canoe or kayak since the water is so clear and lovely and the scenery was so beautiful.  They had a place where you could rent right on site so that is nice.  If you are in this area this is an amazing place to visit if you enjoy the natural beauty of Florida.

7/23/2019,"The float down the river was so much fun with 4 friends. To get into the park is $6. Everything is able to paid with cash or card. We got the XL tube with headrest for $7.50 and with the tram ride to the start of the river it cost $14. Definitely worth the payment because they said the walk is about 20 minutes, but the trail looked like it was shaded for the most part. I brought my phone in a water proof holder and a TAL water bottle but wish I had left it in the car because it was a hassle to try to keep up with them on the float because there a lot of trees and logs in the water. With the current, you sometimes are pushed into them and have to maneuver yourself around them which would have been much easier without any belongings. One thing I noticed, if you bring your own float, make sure you have it CLEARLY marked with a name because you put the floats on a cage attached to the back of the tram. Then when you get to the start of the river, the employees just take them off. A family that was there brought their own very nice floats from home and others on the tram picked them up because there isn‚Äôt a system to it. There‚Äôs also other springs to swim in that are beautiful. Be sure to bring snacks, there is a concession stand but the line was crazy long and moving very slow.

7/22/2020,"We did the full tube float and it took about 2.5 hours from getting on the tram, walking to cast off, floating, and returning to parking lot (via tram).  The river is beautiful and calm.  We saw a hawk, a crane, and 2 turtles (along with many fish).  There were some obstacles we weren‚Äôt expecting and highly recommend inexperienced swimmers ride along with mom/dad in a double tube.  Also, if you get a chance to acquire a stick - it may come in handy to get you out of a stuck situation (if you don‚Äôt have a paddle).  The exit is a little rough because of the rough/slippery rock combined with current.  After our float down the river we went to the head spring to swim.

We went on a week day in the summer & it was an overcast, so we felt like the only ones there.  We were concerned about a storm coming in, the team was patient and understanding in helping us still explore the park.  We decided to do the shorter route, just to make sure we didn't get caught in a storm, and it was beautiful.  Cannot wait to go back for the full experience!  We also took a swim in the lagoon, COLD, but wonderful experience!  There are some more shallow spots, but be sure if you have kiddos to bring a life jacket.   Our family really enjoyed their snorkel sets in the lagoon!  If you want to take a snack on the tubes, you cannot have anything that is disposable, fruit/snacks must be in Tupperware-not baggies.  They do not want any trash left behind.  There is a small snack bar and bathrooms, you can tailgate or eat lunch at the park.

The river water was about the temperature that I would expect for a pool in similar weather conditions -- a little chilly at first, but feels good after a while. We only saw fish and turtles (the signs about alligators made my daughters overly nervous). I wish the longer journey was available in the off-season.We hiked to the Blue Hole, but the water was WAY too cold for swimming.

Once we were at the parking lot, we had to go in line for the tram pass and pay for air for our tubes since we brought our own. We were able to go through tubing twice and we ate lunch at the park. The concession stand was pretty reasonable. We all had chicken ranch wrap with fries for $7.95 each. We brought our own Hydro flask full of ice. We filled it with our own water and tea.

6/12/2020,"My review would be a 5 start except thanks to the dumb POS that have the north entrance closed ‚Äúdue to covid‚Äù and then direct you to the midpoint launch at the south entrance, only to then find out after paying and going in that the walk(the team/shuttle which was PACKED) only allows tubes(no kayaks or paddle boards) and otherwise the walk is a 10 minute walk. So after both entrances saw we had 3 small children and 4 giant kayak/paddle boards and never have mentioned this, to the turned around and went back. Fortunately for us we still had a 15 minutes trip from a family members home once you are out of the state park to partake in the wonders of the river, but anyone coming w far ways would be pissed beyond belief that no one knows or states this in advance. The north entrance and the south entrance workers have no idea what the other is doing. The raft rental company inside of the south entrance also enforced us once we were past the 10 minute walk(which anyone with a kayak would know more than 25-50 feet is about too far to carry one and kayakers 100% already can obey covid-19‚Äôs 6 feet rule but on a very busy day on the river on a raft there would be an extremely large amount of rule breakers so there is absolutely no reason why tubing should be allowed but kayakers can‚Äôt) but then the rental company had the audacity to inform us even if we did enter at the south entrance we would then have to paddle north(upstream) to get to the midpoint then be then allowed to kayak south(total BS nonsense) so my rate should be zero but I know how beautiful the river is and the rating would NEVER not be 5 stars if anyone with a brain took 1 minutes to think about the best way to handle this pandemic.

Wonderful place to spend a day out with your family.  They have kayak rentals but there doesn't seem to be anything unique there and I would save that to do somewhere else. BUT...when we were about an hour away from the park heading home, I began getting alerts from credit card companies and my bank.  I thought with the first alert that it was spam until I looked in my wallet located in the glove compartment (I know-not smart) and found my debit and several credit cards missing.  The alerts kept coming and the panic set in.  The thieves were able to use my debit card and credit cards to purchase a few thousand worth of merchandise at several stores in an hour.  I heard that crime is high in West Palm but you never think that you will be a victim.How did they get into our car without us even knowing?  It was locked and nothing was out of place.  We thought at first that somehow someone took our car key from our beach bag.  It wasn't until later at home that we saw the driver's door key area had been jimmied though you had to look closely to notice.  I didn't know it was that easy to get into a new key less entry car but it obviously is!  They have lockers for rent if I am not mistaken so you want to do that since some of the parking areas are out a bit and they don't seem to be patrolled.  We live near the beach and often keep our wallets in the car but have never had an issue is all these years but it only takes one time!  It is EASY to break into a car without you even realizing it so take all valuables with you.  We didn't report since we are not from the area so I wonder how often this happens to park visitors?

I understand that there is a tram during certain hours, but not the entire time that the park is open.  The walk is quite nice over the inter-coastal on a boardwalk.

7/16/2019,"Informed by the helpful Tripadvisor reviews, we stopped off on our way up the coast to visit this very small museum, for about an hour. We were not disappointed. We were welcomed by Ranger Jeremy Roundtree, who is a credit to the Florida State Parks Service. This enthusiastic, very knowledgeable and charming young man presents the two main stories this museum has to tell, that of John Gorrie and his ice making machine and the history of the Florida State Parks Service. John Gorrie steals the show, with the kind of story we should all know about and celebrate humanity for. And he‚Äôs the godfather of air conditioning, I mean, who knew? Ranger Roundtree captured the ingenuity, selflessness and humility of Gorrie brilliantly, and even got us to understand how the ice making machine actually worked. The ranger can also tell you why the first female rangers wore jumpsuits and chunky state park service earrings. We learned quite a bit about Florida State Parks, and this part of the coast more generally, including an explanation of the landscape we were about to drive through on US98, still showing the damage wrought by 2018‚Äôs Hurricane Michael.

You can learn the story in this small museum and see a 3/4 scale replica of his ice machine.  Gorrie also had filed a patent on an air conditioning system long before Willis Carrier.  Unfortunately, the patent office never received it so Carrier got credit for air conditioning.

11/6/2019,We travelled here for some snorkelling after snorkelling in Key West previously. The snorkelling boat team (Gage & Hayley) were great and the conditions were very good. The snorkelling was pretty calm (despite being a little bit rough overall) as the reef protects you. We weren't able to get to Christ of the Abyss because of the sea conditions but to be fair we had a plenty good enough time at Grecian rocks. Would definitely recommend.Tip: You can go snorkelling off the beach next to the car park (not a huge amount to see but worth 15-20 minutes of your time) - if you do arrive early and collect your snorkelling gear as it gets collected off you on the boat before you get off so you can't really do it afterwards.,ADocUk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

Also, the guide's voice/PA system was so loud and harsh that it was hard to understand at times.

3/12/2020,"My wife and I did the snorkel trip today and we had a BLAST. The water temp was 75¬∞-77¬∞ as was the air temperature.  No wetsuit needed, and my wife is not a fan of being cold üòÅ- she said it was great. Only saw one family (who brought their own wetsuits) wearing them.  The water was clear with easily 15‚Äô visibility. Parking for two people was $9 and the snorkel was $5 (you keep it) and mask was $2.  Super reasonable. Cap‚Äôn Mike was cool and wanted to make sure everyone was having a great time.  Chris and Annie took care of briefing everyone on safety issues and giving a quick ‚Äúhow to snorkel‚Äù session for noobs or those who wanted a little refresher. You have to (must) wear their safety life vests when in the water.  You can pull the tab to inflate in an emergency.  Kind of lame looking but they did not impede ability to dive down.   We saw a good deal of fish and pretty coral life!   Got some great GoPro videoüëçThe boat had a ice water cooler for drinking and a single toilet stall.  Really easy going day.  We were same day customers, which means, walk in and see if they have availability.  We got last two spots.  Recommend getting reservations if you can.

The snorkeling off the main beach is decent (there is a 'mock' Spanish shipwreck) and lots of unique bottom-dwelling jellyfish, some parrotfish and a few large groupers.  The kayak 'trails' are amazing through the mangroves...plans for at least an hour and up to 2hrs if you do the combo trails.  The small-ish aquarium in the visitors center is impressive for a state park, and the 'all about the Keys underwater' movie is really well-done and informative.

The personnel on the boat were very professional and charismatic. This would be my first time snorkeling and they had a 5 minute basics prior to the snorkeling. We were taken to a reef 30 minutes out and unfortunately didn‚Äôt get to see the undersea statue (aka Jesus) due to weather conditions but had a fun time nonetheless. The time allotted to snorkeling was just right and the amount of fish we saw was astounding!! Probably 30 kinds. Would definitely do again.

Nice detailed maps to help guide you through the maze of canals and mangrove tunnels. Well maintained equipment.  So why only 4 stars? The staff was ""there"".  The guy at the counter was all business, no smile. The boys at the kayaks were more interested in their own conversation than helping customers.  Didn't want to take the time to help make sure PFDs were properly fitted.  Upon return, no questions on the experience - just ""throw the stuff back where you found it"".  I don't expect much but they might as well could've not been there at all. At least then I wouldn't expect a touch of customer service.

12/26/2020,"I've read what a few others have posted about the glass-bottom boat tours, and I'm not sure what they expected, or if they did their homework.Note that much of your experience depends upon the weather. Choppy seas will affect whatever kind of experience you are hoping to have. The park cannot control that. On the day we were there, seas were choppy enough to cause them to cancel the snorkeling trips, but not to cancel the glass-bottom boat tours. My family rented kayaks and spent two hours paddling the kayak trails through the mangroves. It was fabulous. Note that there is a gap between beginner and intermediate trails. And not all intermediate trails are equally difficult. The mangrove tunnel was relatively easy; ""the Whip"" was narrow and difficult.We took the late glass-bottom boat tour. The park is explicit that this tour DOES NOT go to the Christ of the Deep statue. So know what you are paying for. Our tour went to Molasses Reef -- hardly a dead reef, as another poster claimed. We saw a couple of hawksbill turtles, a nurse shark, a variety of parrot fish, and plenty of other fish as well. If you struggle with motion sickness at all, take some dramamine before the tour -- they sell it at the concession if you don't have any.The hikes are rather short, but they made a good interlude between water activities.

8/20/2020,"I had once visited Pennekamp about two decades ago and don‚Äôt remember too much about it other than the beaches being scroungy. Things haven‚Äôt changed that much but it depends on where you go, I guess. Only one beach area was really disgusting and the others seemed okay as many others were swimming in those locations. The prices have gone up, for two of us in a car it is now $9 (mid-August 2020). We decided against getting in the water and opted to go on a trail instead. One of the three trails is still being worked on but we checked out the Wild Tamarind trail. No complaints there, it certainly delivered what you‚Äôd expect from a trail that was very walkable. We appreciated the educational markings throughout the trail that described an array of flora. For us, this is one of those ‚Äúbeen there, done that‚Äù places. We clearly did not do what most people go for, which is the coral so obviously I cannot base anything off of that but that of which we did do, meh.",aajeans,2.0 of 5 bubbles,The Villages,Florida,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

Let me simply add here the ‚Äúorientation‚Äù took about 10 seconds before we were on our way to the kayaks. We specifically told the young man we were interested in a leisurely paddle and stopping at several points for a swim to cool off.  We began paddling looking for markers  for the creeks shown on the map or perhaps a sign. Nothing. we continued our paddle in the same waterway we began with instruction from staff that we would encounter a busy crossover point for boats and that we should use caution when traversing. We continued for about an hour with no markers or signs present and powers boats passing at high rates of speed. Obviously we were not where we were supposed to be and turned back. When we finally located the beach the young man sent us to there were caution signs No kayaks or paddle boards. We continued to the second beach marked off with buoys surrounded by rocks. We then returned back to the launch site an hour and a half after we started  completely disappointed. We expressed this to the staff and they all but ignored the situation CAUTION: if you do plan on going, there is a maker in the channel where you need to turn LEFT, however we were never told this, If you do reach a canal with high, fast boat traffic, you‚Äôre in the wrong place and should go back.",n0reaster,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Bradenton,Florida,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

After checking out the site we drove over to the beach. No one was there, but we did get out of the car and went to see the beach. It was discussting, the smell of rotting seaweed at least 3 feet of it.

They took us out 5 miles into the Atlantic ocean and let us go and explore.  The water was crystal clear, saw tons of different beautiful fish, jellyfish, huge shells and amazing coral. Waves were a little rough but looking underwater and seeing nature was incredible.  We were in the water for at least 1 1/2 hours.

The on-board guide was good and her presentation informative. One member of our group has mobility issues -- she walks with a cane. We had been assured that there was seating for all on board, but that was not the case. Fortunately, when passengers were permitted to move to the fore and aft decks, seating inside opened up. Then, when  over the reef, it became very difficult for her to stand in the rolling sea. The seating around the glass viewing areas is not accessible to those with mobility difficulties, so standing is their only option.

1/10/2020,"Like most people, we were in Key Largo on vacation. That means limited time and flexibility. The boat ride is non-refundable. On the day we were scheduled to go, 1/3/20, it was gorgeous out! Sunny and quite warm. We had planned on taking the 12:15pm boat ride and then stay to swim and snorkel. We check in for the boat ride and are told that the swells are 4-5 feet. We live in Florida and are on boats fairly often but we don't drive boats. To me, if it's safe to go, it's safe to go. And again, what was our choice? We only had one more day and were told that the water would be more rough on Saturday. Okay...we go. My family of five have been on cruises, catamarans, boat tours in Amelia Island and the Virgin Islands. We've already snorkeled before. We had no reason to think there would be any issue today.We get on the boat and are told, ""If you get sea sick, take Dramamine now. It's about 45 minutes to the reef."" I thought that a little odd - as the boat ride started right then. Why would we take Dramamine for the reef and not the ride? Well, it was odd but my family had never been sea sick so we're good. The ride out was quite a ride. We were up and down on those 4-5 foot swells. It was bumpy. Then we began slowing down as we approach the reef. Here....here is where it all came together. I foolishly assumed that the reef had calmer waters. In my head, to see the reef with either shallower waters or somehow protected. I guess I was thinking back to times that I've snorkeled at reefs. That never had rough waters. Ah, but then we are told - you can't snorkel this reef! So...anyone who is thinking of snorkeling type reefs - here is the only heads up you'll get - it's not. This is a open ocean reef with absolutely no protection from weather. If you haven't already figured it out, it was so rough that it was sickening. There are 70 adult life jackets on board. So stating that there were 100 people on the boat would accurate. After being at the reef for fifteen minutes, there were 38 people upstairs on the deck vomiting. 38!!! I counted....as I sat there with my children, who were horribly ill. The captain, Patrick, spent the entire time handing out puke bags, mints, and paper towels. At one point I asked him if this was normal. His response, ""No. This is definitely more spicy than usual.....but better than this mornings ride."" OMG. Then knew it was awful and still took us out. They didn't get us a chance to get a refund and they didn't tell us HOW bad it would be. Shame on them. And it's a shame, because it could of been a great ride. Save your money and go to dinner on the water. Manatees, Sting Rays and all sorts of animals will swim right up.*Side note - we didn't see any animals.

We were a little skeptical as it‚Äôs 75¬∞ with the same water temperature but for a few extra dollars we rented wetsuits that made all the difference. Captain Dan and mate Katy on the Dolphin did a great job explaining the reef, assessing their customers and let everyone enjoy their own space and this beautiful reef.

12/9/2019,"The Pennekamp glass bottom boat tour is pretty unique.  It leaves the state park and heads to the blue water and coral reefs 5-10 miles offshore, a trip that takes about 45 minutes.  The boat was larger than what we expected, and the glass bottom is very well designed.  After the pleasant cruise to the reef‚Äî that I suggest you spend outdoors‚Äî you get to nestle together inside above the 1.25 inch thick plexiglass that separates you from the ocean floor.  Time over the reef was surprisingly long at 45 minutes.  We drifted, mostly, although the Captain would maneuver the boat if needed to visualize particularly interesting sea life.  There are two tiers of viewing.  Those who are younger or more agile will want to be in the lower tier, where you get to sit and hang your legs over the seating area and get the best view through the glass.  The next tier is just above, where viewers stand and see the same portals, only slightly farther away.  Be sure to position yourself near the black ropes of the lower tier if you want the best views and don‚Äôt mind squeezing into a sitting stance.Outside, the boat could use a paint job.  Inside, it is super clean and feels almost new.  They sell reasonably-priced soft drinks and snacks, although you can bring your own onboard.  The crew is friendly, professional and informative, and deserve more than the paltry tips I saw in the tip jar on the way off the boat (we tipped $20).  They have two heads (bathrooms to you landlubbers), but you cannot flush any toilet paper down the commodes; you have to place it in the trash can‚Äî What?!  Lastly, the fish and coral.  After all, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre here for.  I‚Äôve been coming to Pennekamp since the 1980s.  Since then I‚Äôve heard how the coral is stressed and dying.  Some of it is from natural causes, some of it is man-made from excessive diving and environmental carelessness.  Nevertheless, the reef and coral looked tired, stressed and sometimes lifeless.  It‚Äôs not what I snorkeled back in the day.  We did see a couple of tortoises, some sharks, parrot fish and numerous smaller colorful fish.  This is always fun and exciting.  But I did not witness a healthy reef teeming with fish.  That likely exists elsewhere in the Keys, but just not right outside of Pennekamp.One downside to our boat trip was the abundance of feral children.  Oblivious Millennials, who have eschewed common sense, manners and civility, brought aboard their 1 to 3-year-old children who cried, shrieked and blabbered incessantly most of the trip.  This generation can‚Äôt be fixed.  Just be prepared to endure stupid parenting.If you‚Äôve never seen a coral reef and its fish, Pennekamp is a great place to start.  If you‚Äôre a seasoned diver, you have better options elsewhere.  Nevertheless, the glass bottom boat tour is unique, fun and educational.",Professional courtesy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Punta Gorda,Florida,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

Everything was smooth from the checking in to the gear gathering.  Captain Chris and Natalie both have great personalities and are also both are very competent in their job duties.  We were quite lucky and had absolutely fantastic conditions with visibility of 40 feet +.   We were able to see a lot of very interesting sea life and there was only 1 other boat on the reef the entire time we were there.   It It‚Äôs also worth noting that my children and myself were able to use our full face snorkeling masks with this outfit as opposed to the outfit out of Robbies which did not allow them.

We picked this one because it said it was an air conditioned boat...it was not!  After paying $10 just to get into the park and then another $25 per person for the boat ticket, we are herded on board.  They oversold the boat so there were not enough seats for everyone. Many of us had to stand up for the entire time, which was about 3 hours, without any A/C and two little fans in the back of the boat trying to push air around the salon...not fun!  They did not even give us ice water to help cool us down (unless you wanted to spend money at the concession stand).

We booked the 2.5 hour snorkel tour for 10:30 because I thought the water might have better visibility. The boat ride wasn‚Äôt too long and was enjoyable, the captain was entertaining and informative, and the water was gorgeous. Apparently the statue isn‚Äôt always guaranteed due to overcrowding but we were able to pull up and find a spot. The water was very clear, and there were beautiful fish all over. My favorite were the parrotfish. Things to note: If you book a tour, you get an email saying be there 1-1.5 hours early. We arrived early and had no problems but I could easily see it being crowded if you aren‚Äôt on time. Also it appears that booking online is the best way to go. By the time we came back all the tours were sold out and personally, it would suck to deal with keys traffic to find out you can‚Äôt snorkel.Another thing! If you‚Äôre nearsighted like me I highly HIGHLY suggest renting the corrective mask. I‚Äôm a -2.50 in both eyes and they had my RX in a mask and when I put it up to my face I could see perfectly. Makes the experience so much more enjoyable. If you aren‚Äôt the most comfortable with snorkeling or a super strong swimmer they give a great little lesson on the boat and that lesson combined with the little vest you wear that you can blow up with your mouth should take care of your problem. It was my partners first time snorkeling and he‚Äôs not a super comfortable swimmer and he loved it.

7/2/2019,"Captain Dean and Tour Director Amanda provided an amazing snorkel experience.  A private tour for just our party of six family members could not have been a better experience.  Beautiful weather, calm seas, and clear water added to the enjoyment.  We all agreed that the extra expense associated with the private tour was well worth it.  Amanda was great and snorkeled with us and our children the entire time, pointing out different fish species and types of coral. Refreshing drinks and great snacks were also provided.  We would strongly recommend booking a private tour.",Shawn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sanibel,Florida,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/1/2019,Me and my girlfriend decided to head down to the John Pennekamp State Park for their snorkeling trip.  Took the 2.5 hour trip out to the Grecian Rocks Reef.  Nice ride out(Thanks Tom and Doug)and a GREAT spot with a wide array of fish and coral and the water visibility very clear.  Was certainly one of the best snorkeling outings I have gone on.  Make sure you make reservations as it was observed that many of the trips were sold out.  Also they do allow people with experience to hit the water right away.  Would not recommend this trip if you can't swim so good or you have not been on a boat.  Also would not recommend this trip if you gastric issues as you are one with the sea.  Good price and a good time and highly recommend.,smlscorpio65,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Indialantic,Florida,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

Entry for a family of 4 is $10, you can re-enter as many times as you like throughout the day as long as the park is not at capacity.  We found a secluded spot to grill,  there are 2 snorkeling spots off the beaches,  we took a group snorkel tour to the coral reef, and rented kayaks and paddle boards.  We spotted beautiful fish, barracudas, tons of jellyfish, exotic birds, and iguanas.  Don‚Äôt miss the mock shipwreck off cannon beach.  Cant wait to come back!

6/10/2019,"I've been to John Pennekamp Snorkeling trips before and always had a great time. That being said, I was so disappointed on this last trip. There were too many people on the boat. I wasn't able to sit with my kids and two people even sat on the floor. The trip out and in was very uncomfortable because we were squished together. We went to a terrible reef that had nearly nothing to see. Previously I've been to two different reefs with them and it was great. The reef we went to on 6/9/19 should not be on a tour. Having too many people on the boat just made it so miserable. At some point customer comfort has to be above making money.  This was my daughters first time out there and I had told her how great it was, if I hadn't previously had a good experience we would never go back.I truly hope this feedback is taking into consideration by the park.

All of their facilities are clean & the staff is friendly & ready to assist. Although we haven't taken a tour with them, we do visit the reef/sanctuary on our own & it is beautiful. The Statue of the Deep (Christ Statue) & Grecian Rocks are two of our favorites. They are nice, relatively shallow for snorkeling & the Christ Statue makes a nice dive, too.

We're also saw some really seen fish in the park. The water was warm enough that I did not need a wetsuit, about 79 degrees though everyone else diving used one. We're chose to pay extra for a guide,  only $40 for the two tank dive and we felt worth every penny; Chris was amazing and passionate about diving and the marine life. We would highly recommend using a guide as everyone did not see as much as we did on their self guided drives.

The regular snorkeling trips with the park were sold out and she made sure we didn‚Äôt miss out.  As far as the scuba, the trip was well organized.  The equipment was in great shape and it felt very safe.  We had Amanda and captain Dan and they were wonderful about helping all the divers with their equipment, explaining the diving sites and keeping the trip well organized.

Once we were on the boat, both Dan and Amanda (the dive master) ran through correct procedures and protocol before leaving the dock, making us all feel safer in their hands.  After arriving at the first dive site, Dan and Amanda offered additional information on special points of interest to look for on the dive, and further explained procedures for safely exiting and entering the boat,  It seemed that neither ever stopped moving in their efforts to make sure we were all set for the dive, including double-checking our gear, applying spray to our goggles to prevent fogging, even changing over our regulators to the second tank at our next dive site.

We stayed out for 2 hours but were allowed for 4 hours. They give you a map to follow (yellow was easy or White was harder). Very few signs along route in the mangroves on which way to go. You must come back a specific way which we got turned around in finding our way back. You had to go out into the bay to head back which was a little tough with boats going by.Life preservers were pretty well warn.

1/8/2021,"Our family of 7 (my husband and I, and 5 kids ages 8-18) had a great first-time snorkeling experience at John Pennekamp on January 6th! The weather was 70 and sunny; water was calm and temp of 75. I was concerned we‚Äôd be cold, but it wasn‚Äôt a problem at all! Several of us rented half wetsuits which was well worth it, although my husband and 15yo did not and said they got used to the water fine. I hate to be cold in the water and didn‚Äôt want to risk it though. Initially we weren‚Äôt sure what kind of snorkels to get, but the cheapo ones worked fine. Everyone but me got fins, and were glad they did. The staff at John Pennekamp were all so helpful with answering all of our questions, us being newbies.The boat is a giant pontoon boat. My daughter and I are prone to motion sickness, but as I said, water was pretty calm, and we had no trouble on the half hour boat ride each way. Robert and Brian did a great job teaching snorkeling basics on the boat to anyone interested, and helping us have a good experience. We went to Grecian Rocks, and were amazed at the vast amount and variety of fish we saw. It is like a whole different world; so quiet and beautiful. The coral itself was a little ‚Äúboring‚Äù in color and brilliance from what I was imagining in my mind, but the fish exceeded all of our expectations!

12/24/2020,"Family of four (10 and 5) spent the day here enjoying activities including kayaking and a snorkel trip. Weather was windy which had an impact on our activities but as we only had a couple of days left we chose to continue. We rented two tandem kayaks and kayaked through the mangrove. Trails were well marked, saw some fish and enjoyed our two hour trip. Beach was not impressive and I would not recommend unless where you are staying is not on a beach. We brought our own picnic lunch but had ice cream from a local vendor. We then went on the snorkel trip. Vendor originally said nothing to us regarding lack of visibility due to waves/wind. As we were boarding the boat staff asked us if we were sure we wanted to go and if staff had warned us about the weather. As we had already committed we decided to go. While the waves definitely impacted our trip and prevented our 5 year old from getting in we were still glad we went. We were taken to the Grecian Dry Rocks and the dive master told us this was the only option due to the wind.Being from a landlocked state we enjoyed being able to snorkel a decent reef and see fish including barracuda, nurse shark, parrotfish and eagle ray. Mike and Lee (captain and dive master) were great especially Lee. Recognizing the conditions weren‚Äôt great we still had a great time. Would love to go when the conditions are more favorable. Have been on group and private snorkel tours that cost much more and weren‚Äôt as good. $100 for a family of fours very reasonable in my opinion.

We saw a lot of fish but no nurse sharks or turtles on our visit.  We also snorkeled in Key West on our trip.  This reef was much more plentiful with plant and animal life than the ones further south off of Key West. I have snorkeled in Cozumel and Hawaii as well.  While we did enjoy our trip, I personally think that the water clarity and marine life in Hawaii is definitely better than the reefs of Florida.",WhoDatFan92,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Houma,Louisiana,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

1/20/2020,"This is a beautiful park. My family went on the glass bottom boat trip, and had, for the most part, a great time. We saw a wide variety of fish, and a couple of sharks. The main reason for the score of 3 was that the boat staff seemed indifferent to their guests. The park staff are excellent. The boat staff, however, were really indifferent, to the point of rudeness. My daughter has autism, and it really helps her, to know what is going to be happening, ahead of time. I wasn't sure if she would be able to see, from where she was sitting, so I asked. Now, we have done a lot of different kinds of tours, and I have dealt with all kinds of tour guides. I was expecting to at least get a polite answer. The woman that I asked just put on a really forced smile, and said ""I'll get to that, in a minute"". When I tried to explain that I was asking so that I could explain how things were going to work, to my daughter, she just repeated, "" I said, I'll explain all of it, in a minute"" in a super sticky sweet kind of condescending way. My daughter ended up crying through most of the reef part, and not one staff member stopped to try to help. So basically, the 3 is an average of the boat ride and reef, which was a five, and the guides, who while knowledgeable, were neither compassionate, nor polite, and were a 1.",ShawnaK,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Newport,Maine,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

My husband and I are not avid snorkelers but after researching a bunch of places in the Keys, decided on the 2.5 snorkel trip out of the park.  The ride into the ocean was about 1/2 hour, was not rough and went very quickly.  Spent an hour or so in the water (perfect amount of time for me) and saw a ton of different, vibrant colored fish.  The porcupine fish, eel and scrawl filefish were my favorites.  If you want to experience snorkeling in the Keys, but also be able to do other things in the same day, I highly recommend this snorkel company!",JoJoEC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Long Island,New York,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

We were even lucky enough to see some super cute dolphin while leaving the canal! The snorkel itself was great, especially for my boyfriend who had never done this before! We also saw Christ of the Abyss, which was just as beautiful in real life as it is in the photos. One annoying thing that isn't related to the crew at all is that the instructions email told us to arrive an hour and a half early so we got to the park gate at 7:30AM only to find it doesn't open until 8A.",AmandaC-inNYC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,New York,New York,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

We went snorkeling with the group on Robbie‚Äôs pier the day after Pennekamp but we didn‚Äôt see as many fish with them. We were blown away with the variety of bright fish at Pennekamp.

Unfortunately, we did not see a turtle at the reef, but saw one on the way back to shore.The boat captains were also awesome.  Catie and Katie provided clear instructions and were also super helpful, knowledgeable, nice, and fun.  Outside of going to Dry Tortugas, this is the best snorkeling experience in the Keys.

12/31/2019,"My husband, 9 year old son and I did the noon snorkel tour today on the Sea Garden. We booked in advance and pre rented fins, we had our own masks and snorkels. Everything was very well run from check in, to getting our gear etc. Everything also ran on time. Our tour on the Sea Garden was captained by Mike and the go to in the water and for safety was Katie. Both were incrediblely patient, knowledgeable and kind. It was my son's first time and he was nervous as the boat left the dock. Katie had encouraging words for him which really seemed to help. Unfortunately, there was a man o war warning posted, which we were openly told about. Leave it to me to get stung on the face! Captain Mike and Katie were great. They were helpful, stayed calm and gave me tips on how to treat it after Mike removed the tentacle. Both were complete pros. We will definitely be back to Largo and our son is already asking when we can snorkel again and won't stop talking about all of the different fish he saw.

7/25/2019,"Think before visiting this park. The cost is reasonable, however the park appears to be in poor condition and needs to spend some funds bringing the state of the park in better shape. We spent approximately three hours at the park. One beach was overrun by seaweed, which was not a controllable problem, however better signage and closing the beach due to sewage smell and likely poor and unhealthy water conditions would have been the better way to handle. Signage is present to warn of the presence of crocodiles, however this is not present at the entrance. Consider this danger if you have small children.

7/7/2019,"John Pennekamp Park has a lot of activities to offer. After paying a small admission fee/vehicle you have access to nice beach areas, mangrove hikes and snorkeling. They rent snorkeling gear if you don‚Äôt have your own. Also, they offer extra purchases of SCUBA and snorkel trips, glass bottom boat trips, and many other activities. Our family of 5 did a private snorkel trip. A captain and a diver master brought us to several great wrecks and reefs, always pointing out things for us to see and educating us on the sites and sea life. This was, of course, more expensive than the large party boat option, but we thought it was worth the extra to get away from the crowds and have a personalized experience. We would definitely recommend.",Holly K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Huntersville,North Carolina,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews
6/9/2019,"We stayed at John Pennekamp during an RV island hopping trip in the Florida Keys. John Pennekamp was our first stop and it did not disappoint. The resort is very lush and well-maintained. If you have never been here before and looked at the map online, it looks huge, but it is quite manageable to get around and you can walk to most areas. Our RV was parked at site 38 which was perfect because it was very close to the bath house. The sites are close, but there is some landscaping in between giving a sense of privacy. The other residents were quiet and respectful. The bathhouses are very clean and there were even decorator shower curtains in the large shower stalls. Water had great pressure. Washer and dryers are also located at the bathhouse and are $1.50 (quarters) a load for each wash and dry. We did the early morning snorkel tour and were lucky that the weather was good enough to get to see the Christ of the Abyss statue. Beaches are clean, but when we were here there was a brown algae on the water's edge. This is a natural bloom and it has a bit of a smell.  The far beach over the wooden bridge was nice. Palm trees provided shade and the beach to the left of that had a rocky bottom good for some basic snorkeling. The water here is somewhat clear but not emerald or turquoise. This is due to the run off from the everglades (or so I was told). Overall, a great experience and I would recommend this park.",atinnell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Charlotte,North Carolina,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews
5/28/2019,We snorkeled the reef with Amanda as a guide and Dan as Captain. Amanda was awesome and loved hearing her talk about her passion for the waters and animal life within.

4/26/2019,"If I recall correctly, entrance to the park was per person.  Plenty of parking.  There is a small aquarium that was free with entrance to the park.  There was a small beach where it seemed as though most people were just hanging out waiting on their tour times.  They do snorkeling tours and glass bottom tours for an additional fee.  Not sure what else, we just took part in the snorkeling ourselves.  I will add that if you do not feel safe in the middle of the ocean swimming please stay close to whomever you are with.  We had quite the experience due to strong currents with my boyfriend.  There were a few other people on our tour that had some issues as well.  Only had 2 workers on the boat and there was at least 40 people snorkeling for them to look after.   2 of the 3 of our party did get to see the Christ of the Abyss which was cool to see live.

Captain Mike was able to give us a spectacular dolphin show on the way back in! He would rotate the boat around so that the dolphin could have the waves made by the wake of the boat to show off and we were able to get some amazing pictures and videos!!

We planned to spend a couple hours at the park and ended up spending the entire day. We kayaked around the mangrove trees, the wildlife and water cleanliness was amazing. We took a 2 hour tour on their glass bottom boat, what a nice experience. Very friendly and informative staff, the educated us not only concerning the reef but nearly everything we encountered around the area, such as history of the park and the reef it's self, to the local wildlife. The reef is amazing and easy viewing from the glass bottom boat. We were able to see many fish in there natural environment. We also had lunch at their food truck, sorry, I forget the name. What a great surprise, the quality of the food was amazing with really good prices. Everything is cooked after you have ordered so it's hot and fresh. To be honest, one of the best lunches of the week! Lastly we walked two different walking trails, a lot of local wild life and beautiful trees, bushes, and flowers. Everything was well marked and walking the trail was easy. If I could suggest one thing to make your visit to John Pennekamp park even better, Don't forget the bug spray, we didn't bring any and within minutes were eaten alive. They did offer some for sale in the gift shop, problem solved. Will visit again when in the area again.

When she return she seemed annoyed with my 1/2 of one question and told me to just find my answers online. I told her I didn't see the answers online and continued with my questions. After a couple of half answered questions she said she has customers and other phones she needs to attend to and I would have to wait until she was done.

4/21/2019,"My mom and I were looking for a beach in the Keys and drove to the state park after some great reviews. When we got there, we asked the ranger if we could simply drive in, look at the beaches, and drive back out (we got there at 6 pm or so). He would NOT let us go in for free just to look around, we even asked if he could take our phones and we could get them on the way back. When you are not in the area, it is hard to know what the beach looks like without physically going, and having to pay to get in to drive around for 5 minutes was annoying.The two beaches are extremely small, probably 3 car lengths long and not enough for a relaxing time away from big groups of people and children. They are NOT real beaches if you are looking for that in the keys, they are manmade and the water is surrounded by mangroves, so it is not clean. This is NOT a place for you to go if you are looking for a ""beach"" vacation. This is more of a ""park"" feel (yes, I know it is a state park, but if you are a beach person you'll get what I am saying). They do have snorkeling and scuba diving which we did not do because they were booked, but the pictures look neat.",Sam,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Lebanon,Tennessee,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews
4/14/2019,"Used to be a frequent Scuba Diver and snorkeler. Last trip was probably in 1985.  The when did you travel box does not allow for long time past travel.  That said, I have always loved Pennekamp. First trip was in '76, learned to snorkel there. At the main park area there is a beach on Key Largo.  It's sort of like a very deep lagoon. While snorkeling in the ocean for the first time I met a scuba diver who was having problems with his gear.  He explained how every thing was supposed work and told me about the problems he was having. That was the first time I met a diver. After college I returned to Pennekamp for my first open water ocean dives. I've done day and night Scuba and Snorkeling on the reefs, they are some of the best in the world. Caught my first lobster there. There are plenty of good boats that will take you out to the reefs off shore.  If you want great diving that's easy to get to Pennekamp is the place.

6/4/2019,"We had a great time on this trip, and for the money, it's well worth it.  However, the FAQs say ""weather permitting"" the tour will take you to Christ of the Deep, which is what we really wanted to see.  Our boat stopped at a reef, and it was great snorkeling, although somewhat windy.  When I asked if we were going to the statue, the captain said ""No, it's over there (1/2 mile or so away) and we aren't going there today.""  I wish this had been clear when we signed up.  Obviously the weather permitted us to go to the reef so why not also the statue a short distance away?  That was really the only disappointing part of the trip as it was the thing I wanted to see most, and since the ""weather permitted"" us to go out at all, I was expecting to see the statue.  So...if you're expecting to see the statue you may want to clarify which trips go there and which don't before you sign up.

Saw colorful tropical fish of all sorts, a sea ray, an eel, and barracuda. Also had three different kinds of jellyfish that were present. Easily avoidable and easily seen since the water is crystal clear. There is no beach or any thing you can stand on out at the reef. You are a floating the whole time and should not stand even where it is shallow. Out there for about 45 minutes as far as snorkel time. Trip out takes 35 minutes one-way on the boat.

4/16/2019,"We got to enjoy the beautiful coral reef that is a part of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park though we didn't book a dive trip through the park but rather through another diving company. Seeing this precious reef and all of the amazing life that depends on it really reinforced for me the importance of preservation like this through state parks. It was great to meet accomplished divers who had come all the way from places all over the world to visit this marine environment, known as one of the best places to dive, and they told me it really was as spectacular as they'd hoped. We returned to John Pennekamp State Park another day on our vacation to take advantage of even more offerings. We spent a couple of hours hiking on two different easy trails which I enjoyed so much more than I'd expected--we saw hundreds of wonderful lizards, a huge golden orb weaver spider in a splendid web, a large iguana in a tree, and some lovely birds, along with the interesting plants and trees. On one trail, there were markers by trees and plants to indicate types and share facts, which I appreciated. We had brought a picnic so we ate at nice clean tables under a structure for shade, where a delightful ibis wandered up and seemed interested in my sandwich. After lunch, we rented kayaks and floated around the mangrove trails, which was very enjoyable. It wasn't a challenging kayak trip, but it was enjoyable and beautiful. Finally, we went swimming at the beach. I have seen some poor reviews of the beach, and I can see why they were disappointed. It is small, the sand is hard and pitted, and the swimming area is roped in, quite a small area, and murky. But it was a hot day and there were many people there seeming to enjoy themselves thoroughly, lying under umbrellas or snorkeling around the shallows. I saw kids especially having a good time, just glad to cut the heat with some splashing around.I think you just shouldn't have expectations of good swimming beaches in Key Largo. We were told ahead of time at our hotel that there aren't good swimming beaches in the area, that it's best to enjoy going out on a boat to snorkel or dive if you want to experience the really beautiful water.  On our last day of vacation we returned to John Pennekamp on a whim for a trip on the glass bottom boat. We were warned that there were 5-foot waves out in the open ocean and that it would be a rough journey, possibly inducing sea sickness. We went ahead, feeling confident. As a precaution we decided to spring for the dramamine tablets they were selling on board, and we were glad we did. It was a very hot day, which I think exacerbated people's feelings of seasickness, but the boat was definitely rolling and I think at least a quarter of the people on board quickly made their way to the top deck, away from the viewing panes inside, to get fresh air and try to feel better. Many people were to be seen clutching the sick bags that were luckily free and within easy reach! Unless you have lots of experience out on the open ocean, you don't know how your body will react, so it's best to play it safe and take motion sickness pills ahead of time. I managed pretty well but still felt a little queasy after a while of being in the crowded, warm cabin, looking down at the sea floor.  I spent most time on the upper deck, which I still really enjoyed. On the way in and out from the reef, a guide alerted us over the speakers when there were interesting birds or other life to see, and also told us about the unique properties of mangroves. There were cool things to be seen through the viewing panes when we reached the reef and the guide was really informative and friendly. All of the staff were very good, but special praise is due to a staff member (wish I knew his name...) who spent the whole trip on the upper deck handing out paper towels and bags to seasick passengers, gently inquiring about how they were feeling, checking in on everyone. It was actually one of the most heart-warming things I've seen in a long time to see someone going beyond their job description to be so encouraging and kind to people who were feeling pretty rotten. So, I recommend this trip, but be realistic about your reaction to sea motion and take dramamine if you are iffy! And wear protective clothing and sunscreen because you'll spend a lot of time on the upper deck with no shade if you get sick from being inside. The last thing I'd like to praise John Pennekamp state park for is for basic good facilities. Bathrooms and shower spaces were clean and functional, picnic areas were well-maintained and plentiful. The visitors center was excellent--I had to be pried away from aquariums filled with fish, hermit crabs, coral, lobsters, and urchins and displays with interesting facts about the wildlife and landscape. Also, it's lovely to take a break from the hot sunshine and sit in the dim coolness of the little movie theater watching a film about the reef and all of the life it supports!",olimer80,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Arlington,Virginia,United States,John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Parktripadvisorreviews

11/11/2020,Have been staying at Pennekamp campground and diving with Pennekamp for years. They are the best scuba operation in the Key Largo area. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and equipment is first rate. Safety is a priority and I trust the staff. Unfortunately over the last few years the priority of the management has shifted from scuba to snorkeling. Currently (weather permitting) the snorkeling and glass bottom boats are going out. No scuba. I just hate to see the scuba operation so limited. I understand all the mess with Covid but if the snorkeling and glass bottom boat can operate why not the scuba.

The beach was a bit small, there is a place to swim and it is worth visiting the aquarium center that is free to get into. The park has a fee to get in. I think a party of four was around $15.

1/6/2020,"We went to this park three days in a row.  The first day, we saw the hour-long film about the coral reefs and all the creatures inhabiting the reefs.  Excellent film!  We also took a short walk to the historic key lime grove, which was ok but nothing exciting.  The other trail was closed for maintenance......The second day, we rented kayaks and went kayaking in the mangroves, something we had also done in Key West.  They give you a map (coated with plastic), but unfortunately, the map does not depict the area correctly, nor does it cover the entire area where one could kayak.  In addition, there was virtually NO signage.  One channel with mangroves looks exactly like the next one!  We did half the trails and decided to call it a day, as the other section would be more of the same.  When we mentioned to the guy who took the kayak that the map was bad, he said he had heard that from a lot of other people.  Great!!!  Also, as I stepped out of the kayak, I noticed nearby a bottlecap that had been in the shallow water long enough to have rusted.  Who is paying attention?The third day, we took the snorkeling trip.  The water was very rough, which apparently it is in December.  However, people could waste hours here waiting for a tour that never happens.  We were told that the 12 noon tour was definitely going out.   Some other people had signed up, right before noon, for the 3 pm.  If 13 other people didn't sign up by 3 pm, there would be no trip, and they would have wasted basically half a day.  I get the economics of it, but it is not tourist-friendly.

The facilities are nice and very clean.  There is a small store with the necessities,  sun screen,  bug repellent,  snacks,  refreshments, etc.The area that  we saw did not have much of a tree canopy, so i guess it can be pretty hot to have a picnic or to go on a hike, but I didn't see the entire park so other areas may be better suited for those activities.",Ms_R33480,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Palm Beach,Florida,United States,Jonathan Dickinson State Parktripadvisorreviews

This morning we decided to try it,  My husband and adult daughter arrived an hour early and purchased tickets for the 1:15 ride.  They didn't even start saddling anyone until almost 2.  Instead of saddling in the order of ticket purchase, they just started putting people on horses.  Apparently whoever running the event is mathematically challenged and didn't realize until everyone else was on, that they had oversold tickets.  After being present since 12:15 and waiting nearly 2 hours, they were told they ran out of horses.  I know they get busy, but if they had anyone there that was organized this could not have happened.  We will never be able to convince my husband to go again.

9/30/2019,"Have you ever gone back to a place you have good memories of and been so disappointed you want to cry? Yesterday was the first time I've had that happen to me and it seriously rocked me.I've gone to Jonathan Dickinson State Park over the decades, first camping in the 70s and 80s, then taking my own children and my son's scout troop there in the 90s and early 2000s (I was the Cub Scout leader and we took a fun excursion to Trapper Nelson's in 2001) Moving back to Florida this year, I decided to show my significant other what a nice place JDSP was, my memories firmly intact. It only took about 20 minutes to have me almost in tears. Of course, the big Australian pines are gone. In their place is a scraggly mess that they call a campground. In all honesty, I can't imagine anyone wanting to camp there. The ""cabins"" looked equally dismal. Again, why, WHY would anyone stay here at a cost that rivals an AirBnb? Not for a feeling of ""wilderness"" I can assure you unless your version of wilderness is being surrounded by dead scrub and cabins that look like mobile home cast-offs. But what depressed me most was the area down near the kayaks and boat launch on the river. I remember a well-maintained green area with a playground, picnic pavillions and a cute little shop and lunch place. It seriously looks like the last time this place was maintained was back when I was there with the Cub Scouts 20 years ago. The picnic tables are at least that old and the whole area looks sad and neglected. The railings down at the boat dock are so rickety, they pose a severe safety issue. Of course, there are now 3 pontoon boats instead of the 1 I remember so perhaps this is where their priority is and where all their budget is going. I don't know. I know there are ""renovations"" supposedly underway but why they waited for this long is a mystery to me. Let me just say that I have been to state parks throughout the country and this is by far the most disappointing mess I have ever been to. The fact that I have so many fond memories of this park makes me wonder if I'm losing my mind or just that the state of Florida has some serious issues with their priorities when it comes to their natural resources. But of course, I already know the answer to that one.",haydencandice,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Port St. Lucie,Florida,United States,Jonathan Dickinson State Parktripadvisorreviews

6/8/2019,"Immensely disappointed during our week long camping (RV) visit. I am a HUGE fan of Florida State Parks. This facility is essentially a ""nature preserve"" so it looks a bit haggard and uninviting. The same can be said of some employees. Yuk. Rangers ignored dogs running loose and noisy rednecks. Instead, they stopped by tents (I mean every single day for hours) smoking cigarettes, and gabbing with tent buddy residents. The place almost looks like a massive homeless shelter (tent city). The park hosts seemed very nice and capable, but struggled to keep the place clean (see previous sentence). The  on site concession was appalling. Very high prices, poor quality (how about soaking wet firewood for $9.00/bundle?) with a ""take it or leave it"" attitude -- knowing it was a FOUR MILE drive ONE WAY back to the park entrance with another few miles to find any type store. We made it a point to stop by Publix while out so as not to enrich these people. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay in the area by staying away from the park during the day.

4/2/2019,"Let me start by saying some of my favorite state parks and best maintained are in Florida. Jonathan Dickinson State Park is a great place to visit  with lots to do. My complaint is against the cabins. They are not cleaned or maintained well at all.  I wish there was a way to post the pictures I took. The shower drain was completely clogged, one of the chairs in the kitchen was completely broke. The toaster was broke, the vent hood fan in the kitchen was broke, water stains on the ceiling, hvac filter cover covered in rust and dust, rust all over the refrigerator. Worst of all is all of the dead bugs found in every corner of the cabin. There were 30+ dead bugs on the base of the lamp next to the couch.  We let the front office know and showed them the pictures we took but never received a follow-up call or apology.  For the $100 a night cabin rate I recommend staying at one of the local hotels.  The guidebook in the cabin lists a canoe trip option where they drop you off at Riverbend Park and you can float back to Jonathan Dickinson for $55. I took this trip 4 years ago and wanted to do it again . When I inquired about it at the park they said they discontinued that trip 3 or 4 years ago.

Not sure whether that is good or bad!For some reason, the visitor center is at the very far end of the park from the main entrance. I don‚Äôt why it is set up that way but you have to drive about ten minutes before you can obtain a map and inquire about activities. Be sure to listen to the directions from the ranger at the entrance to the park because there aren‚Äôt many signs. It would have been helpful to be able to obtain a map when you first enter the park.",Tracy H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,New York,New York,United States,Jonathan Dickinson State Parktripadvisorreviews
12/15/2020,We enjoyed the boat trip but wished I had been told when I called ahead that I could call the morning we planned to visit and be told which times the boat would be able to go all the way to Trapper Nelson's based on the tides. The website was outdated and we were surprised to find the visitors center closed due to Covid. We were glad we could climb the tower and enjoy the views on a gorgeous day. Fun to see a big gator at the designated viewing spot. Bathrooms were adequate. Nice to be able to buy cold drinks and ice cream at the concession stand. ,Nancy K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Greensboro,North Carolina,United States,Jonathan Dickinson State Parktripadvisorreviews
3/20/2019,"We entered the park and walked up to the observation platform.  I would recommend doing that.  It gives a nice overview of the park. Next, we made our way to the boat Rental area.  We rented a small boat and toured the lagoon at high tide.  There was not a LOT of wildlife visible then.  A few herons, Egrets and Turtles.  I was hoping to find a Florida Scrub jay.  We did fond one but, it was not close enough for that perfect picture. There are nice trails and a nice campground at the park. We only walked a short distance on the trails. They were great for biking or hiking.Overall, It was a great place to visit away from the beach scene.

12/22/2019,"Spend a week in one of the cabins, which are ""cozy"" but wonderful, with and have full kitchens. The park itself is a gem with beautiful hiking trails and wildlife in abundance. The only downside is there are too many mountain bikers on some trails - not a good idea when you have rare species in the park.

There are restrooms with showers in this loop as well as the family camping area. Facilities were clean. Beautiful night skies-Milky Way was clearly visible once the clouds cleared. Plenty of hiking trails around the area. The Florida Trail passes right through the campground. Being that it is so far removed from civilization, make sure you pack everything you need, because it‚Äôs a haul to get to a store and pick up odds and ends.

On my ride in to the campground I saw deer, Falcon (caracara), and rabbits. Oh, and don‚Äôt forget the buzzards in the old dead tree. Looking forward to a return visit so I can shoot the dark skies.

The campsites are level, spacious and clean as are the bathrooms and showers. But the highlight of the park is all that nature has to offer. Beautiful vistas, starlit nights, and numerous wildlife...this morning we awoke to a huge Tom turkey and four turkey hens right outside our RV. Yesterday we saw alligators, numerous birds including at least one endangered species, a crested caracara, deer, and a wild pig with her babies, and numerous wild orchids growing up in trees while on the prairie buggy ride.

They also have one washer and dryer which we used.  The park is not very close to much of anything so be prepared with all your groceries before you get there.  The roads were great for bike riding and there are several trails.  The trails are mostly in the sun so if hot and sunny, be sure to have a hat and water.  There is an area where you can go see some very large alligators as well.  However, the best thing was the night sky.  This is considered a ""dark"" area and astronomers come here to view the night sky.  I have never seen so many stars.  It was spectacular.

Mainly nothing but saw palmetto for miles on end dotted with an occasional hammock, we did see several smaller gators and deer. However, the hiking is along a packed grass bushhogged trail in open sun for several miles, so you better have plenty of water and protection from the sun. We noticed most people here came for the star gazing experience. There is camping, including primitive, and amazingly most of the sites are under shade.

It is part of Florida ¬¥s history. The 5$ entrance ticket gives you access to the large domain with several buildings. You can have a look from the windows and see what it looked like inside the cabins. It‚Äôs maybe better to have a guided tour, I found that little was really explained about the religious beliefs of the Koreshan.There is a short hick along the river we did not do but looked very nice.Definitely worth a visit on your way to Naples or Fort Myers.",Pichtee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Lausanne,Vaud,Switzerland,Koreshan State Parktripadvisorreviews

Roving voluntary docents are happy to answer question or share quirky tidbits--and there are many! Please check ahead for current availability and events. Philosophers and thinkers will also be a prime audience for Koreshan Village. Here intelligent, educated, wealthy people were duped. They had enormous faith. It was not their faith that failed them.

There are kayak and canoes available for rent or you can bring your own as well. The cost for boat launches is $4 per boat.The Koreshan State Park is also host to a local farmer's market every Sunday from 9am to 1pm. From fresh fruits, local honey and delicious foods and drinks, there is something for everyone there. We bought local honey, a boldo tree (which I had been looking for quite some time) and some bags of local and freshly made kettle popcorn, which by the way were delicious and the best I've had in a long time.The place is a true paradise for photographers or anyone looking to have pictures with a beautiful nature background. The Estero River crosses right through the park and it's perfect for pictures in the water rather than the beach.Nature really thrives at the Koreshan, we saw many butterflies, birds, and a tortoise. There is always the possibility of seeing a gators, after all this is Florida but thankfully we did not lolI'd recommend this park to anyone, my husband and I enjoyed and so did our young children and we also saw many elderly folks enjoying themselves and the history of the place.Definitely check it out if you are interested in learning about the history of Estero and the people that were in charge of the Koreshan and if you simply enjoy beautiful nature and a good hike.Next time we go back, it won't be on a Sunday and we will be bringing our own food and drink and having a picnic.

The historic buildings, plaques and a video presentation fascinate and teach about one of the strangest and most unique utopian religious sects to ever exist in the USA.

I won't spoil any of the surprises, but you owe it to yourself, to go, see the sights, and go on a docent led tour of the facilities.

I went here to explore the hiking trails to take photos of the bamboo forests. There are 3 trails of varying lengths that run off each other so you can go for a short walk or link them together to take a much longer hike surrounding the entire state park. That was quite enjoyable on its own, then there's also the historic settlement on the grounds that you can explore. It's got quite a story and between the trails and the settlement there was plenty of natural shade to make it enjoyable even on the hot sunny day that I was there.

The rules included celibacy and people were supposed to be immortal.Everyone had to give all their earthly possessions and money to the leader who knew the best how to live.The affairs of the settlement were governed by a council of women of ""The Seven Sisters."" The Seven Sisters lived in a common house referred to as The Planetary Court. You can visit the simple but fascinating buildings of this utopian commune including The Planetary Court, the Bakery, workshops. The commune performed opera, concerts and theater. We watched the demonstration of the eighty horsepower Fairbanks-Morse engine powered  Westinghouse generator which provided the electric for the commune. You can see it in the Generator Building during presentations performed by very knowledgeable gentlemen volunteers. There is an educational movie continuously being presented in one of the buildings. Either watch it or read about the cult prior to your visit; it makes it yet more interesting.Estero river is scenic and truly beautiful. You can watch birds, turtles and manatees or just admire the beauty of local flora. We rented a canoe and enjoyed couple of hours of river journey. It was very inexpensive and pleasant.The bamboo hike is also fun. We picnicked in a designated area.Koreshan State Park is a fun place for all ages.

I was greeted by a very friendly and helpful ranger who seemed proud to introduce visitors to the park. She showed me exactly where to go to find the spring and warned me about slippery ground. The spring itself looked green, not blue, but still very clear and quite beautiful. There are two swimming holes separated by a rocky land bridge.

Located just minutes from The Villages, this little park connects one to a huge variety of Floridian wildlife and water life. One can rent a kayak or hop on a pontoon tour.  Jeremy, the pontoon guide, provides great info -- whether you're into wildlife, fishing, boating or kayaking.  Alligators, tons of birds and an ample supply of water views will be waiting.  The pontoon tour costs $15 per person and lasts between 60-90 minutes.  Take a picnic lunch and cooler and plan to stay after the trip.  This park is clean, has a nice playground for children, and the employees/volunteers are some of the friendliest you will encounter in your travels. Don't forget to visit Florida's second largest oak tree also located in the park.  As you enter the park after you pay the $5.00 entry fee, the tree is located on a little path on your left.

4/6/2019,"I have to say we were very disappointed in Lake Griffin State Park. First off, the campground road is awful....couldn't ride bikes safely because of very sandy conditions. We had site 13 and worked for a good hour trying everything we could to get level but could not. By the time we moved the RV to get it as level as we could, we had to use two sewer hoses and it was uphill! Had to constantly walk the hose to empty it. Don't know why they couldn't put some fill in and level it out. Others had the same problem in other sites. The road noise is horrible...don't think I have ever heard so many sirens! Bad shower experience....by the time I was almost finished I was standing in at least three inches of water....gross! The good points are, if you have children there is a beautiful park and play area. Park rangers are very nice, our camp host was awesome and there is a little cafe not far from the park with great food....Fruitland Park Cafe. There are sites that looked nice....just not site 13!",smootb,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Ocala,Florida,United States,Lake Griffin State Parktripadvisorreviews

It's a nice place for a picnic, they have benches and whatnot (they weren't super clean but it's a public park, so it can be expected). We went for a little walk along the trail - there's two, so we decided to go for the longer one once we reached it without realizing that eventually it becomes impassible. Oops. They had a sign about it, we just completely missed it. Definitely pay attention to the sign/map because if we had we would've saved ourselves a lot of trouble. Regardless, it's a nice park but not necessarily a destination - if you're in the area then stop but don't go out of your way.

There are two mounds near the parking area with stairways leading to platforms on top. Interpretive exhibits are informative and scattered about. Some are illegible due to poor condition. The park could use some restoration as a bridge was out on one trail and the platforms are heavily weathered. I sat for a while on top of the large mound and enjoyed the shade and tranquility. I could hear crickets and birds all around. The echo of woodpeckers was also audible. Purple flowers were blooming all over the mounds.

Unfortunately the rules have now changed and you can only rent kayaks on one lake, Hammond Lake. It's not as quiet there and isnt as nice a place to BBQ as it's right next the road, car park, and rental shop. This is a real shame and we will probably seek out a quieter location elsewhere from now on.

7/30/2019,"We've been coming to the Orlando area for many years with our children and only now have we visited the Lake Louisa State Park... our only regret - we should have done it sooner. Beautiful scenery and parkland, interesting wildlife, lovely walks, plus we went horse trekking through the trails. It's only 20 minutes drive from Kissimmee and you really must visit!! A super day out - great place for cycling, pony trekking, walking, swimming in the lake or just exploring with the family... have fun!!",CaWilson157,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Somerset,England,United Kingdom,Lake Louisa State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/25/2019,"Lake Louisa State Park is a real hidden gem for anyone visiting the Orlando area of Florida and wanting a day to chill out from the crowds and hustle of the Theme Parks, then this is certainly the place to come to.Situated on Highway 27 about 10 miles North of the 192/Highway 27 intersection it's in easy driving distance for anyone staying in the vicinity of the Theme Parks with access to their own/a hire vehicle.The entrance fee is just $5 per vehicle which then allows you access to the full park until sundown of that particular day.The scenery at the park is just stunning with plenty of wildlife to see if you are prepared to take time to look for them. We've seen Gators, Turtles, Deer plus a variety of wonderful birds.As well as Lake Louisa itself the Park has a number of other lakes including Lake Dixie and Lake Hammond both of which you can explore via hiring onsite canoes.The Park also has numerous Trails if you wish to go walking/hiking ranging in length between half a mile to five and a half miles long. There's also plenty of Tarmac roads if you wish to explore via bike, and you can go swimmimg/bathing in Lake Louisa.We've been going back to Lake Louisa State Park for ten years now on our trips to Orlando and this is just the best place to go to if you fancy a day of downtime.There are lots of places throughout the park to sit and enjoy a picnic so it's strongly advised to take plenty to eat and drink (although no alcohol) and there's also some BBQ facilities if you fancy doing some cooking.My top tip is hire one of the Canoe's available round near the RV park and explore Lakes Dixie & Hammond (they're not cheap but not massively expensive either), it's great fun and a real memorable experience especially for the kids.Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys the outdoors and wants to see real Floridian nature.",Biliousgreen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,East Riding of Yorkshire,England,United Kingdom,Lake Louisa State Parktripadvisorreviews

We enjoyed a picnic by the lakeside, and while we were there, among the wildlife spotted was a cardinal bird (unusual to us Brits) which was stunningly beautiful.There are picnic tables and bbq stands available near the lake, a very short walk from the car park along an easy pathway(boardwalk?), a small children's play area and well kept restrooms.",daddyReading,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Reading,England,United Kingdom,Lake Louisa State Parktripadvisorreviews

We went on almost a full moon and the weather was amazing ! Don‚Äôt think I would like it during mosquito season ( there were some out already!!) or if it was any hotter.

The Stirrup leathers were so hard and had not been oiled. They hurt your legs.  Making for a very uncomfortable ride.  My husband also complained about how uncomfortable his saddle was also. I told them I had ridden all my life, yet they put me on the horse(Star) that they reserve for children and in a childrens saddle.

1/2/2021,"My husband and I were looking for an outdoor adventure to start 2021 right.  We were searching for a State Park that wasn't too far of a drive from our home near Clearwater, Florida when we stumbled across Lake Louisa state park.  It looked like it had several trail options so we threw on our tennis shoes, grabbed water, and headed out.The park has a $5 entry fee that you can pay prior to your arrival and the map is easy to follow.  Once we arrived, we headed for the parking area closest to Lake Louisa and started our 3-mile trek.  The terrain varied--some was sandy, some marshy, and some basic forest ground.  The trails we chose were a medium challenge (sandy portions), but overall was an easy walk.  After our jaunt through the marsh and the forest, we drop to the camping area of the park.  While we felt the campsites were too close to the road and a bit too close together, they were situated on two lakes that had lovely views.This park also offers glamping and cottages for rent.  We'd consider a visit to the cottages for a weekend getaway and would definitely return for hikes.  We'd recommend to anyone looking for a fun Florida hiking experience.",Windi G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Safety Harbor,Florida,United States,Lake Louisa State Parktripadvisorreviews

The Carefree Campsite, the park, the bonding time with my kids unplugged - it was wonderful. There is so much to do in the park alone; beach, horseback riding, canoes and kayaks, but the ""glamping"" was my favorite part. A tent already made up, with bedding and seating - what more could I ask for. The whole experience was so great, we plan to make this an annual trip.",erin m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lake Worth,Florida,United States,Lake Louisa State Parktripadvisorreviews

We brought our own towels, sheets, pillows and blankets just as a safety precaution, however, that was unnecessary, as everything was extremely crisp and clean, and smelled like bleach. Sheets for all beds (including fitted sheets) are in the master bedroom dresser. All towels are in the ‚Äúkids‚Äù bathroom. The best part for me was the screened in porch overlooking the lake. The view is amazing. From watching the kids make s‚Äômores by the fire pit, to a gorgeous sunset, to a hot air balloon floating around in the distance the morning of our departure. We enjoyed fishing, swimming, exploring and just relaxing, away from the hustle and bustle of every day life especially during these hard times for our country. We already booked our next vacation (2 cabins together) because we‚Äôre introducing another family to this ‚Äúhidden‚Äù gem.

The canteen employee was very sweet and did all she could to accommodate  us. She went and got clips to clamp it shut so the bugs wouldn't get in. Then there was holes everywhere in the tent and when it rained everything got soaked. The a/c unit  took forever to start cooling and never really cooled until the evening time. There was nothing to see while kayaking. We were just kayaking for the sake of saying we did. Fishing was tough because all of the Lilly pads that made it almost impossible to bring up a fish with out the line snapping. We weren't able to go horseback riding because it was booked for two weeks out. This was not at all what we were expecting when we planned a carefree camping experience.

Leisurely trail ride, no galloping which is probably a good thing given some of the trail is sand, and the expertise of the casual rider might be lacking for cantering or galloping.   The ladies were thorough re safety and the condition of the horses was good.  Only negative might have been with five riders and the two leaders (one lead lady was out front and one at back of the group), it was very difficult to hear the lead lady's description of the flora and fauna and history of the park, so being numbers four and five horses back of the lead horse was not  good in that regard.   One of the middle horses was also a slow walker so further fell behind the main guide lady.   ",gccs2003,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Leesburg,Florida,United States,Lake Louisa State Parktripadvisorreviews

9/24/2019,"My son had been horseback riding with me once before but we rode together. I took him to Lake Louisa last weekend for his very first solo ride and it was the best time! There are two trail guides (one in front and one in back) and that alone made me feel so much more comfortable. My son was a little nervous once he stood next to the horses and saw the size up close but the two guides put him at ease and explained every last detail of what we would be doing. They also have him excellent instruction on how he would be handling his horse. They made him feel confident in his ability to lead his horse, Scarlett. Once on the trail they pointed out different kinds of plants, animal trails, gopher tortoise burrows and we even spotted a few deer and a raccoon. My son is very shy around new people and he was comfortable enough to start asking some questions as we rode. The guides were so knowledgeable and I really appreciated that! One of the guides is a certified special olympics trainer and does animal therapy for special needs children with her horses on her ranch. At one point my sons horse went off to the right and she very calmly instructed him on how to bring the horse back to the trail. From the start to the end I was so impressed.

7/22/2019,"We booked the Glamping tent for our 7th wedding anniversary. Overall great idea but not great execution. For over $200 a night I would not return or recommend it to others for that price. Maybe if it included fire wood or a canoe rental or something.Everyone we encountered was extremely friendly and welcoming and overall we enjoyed our stay in one of the glamping tents. Pros:The inside was beautifully decorated and well appointed. I was also extremely impressed on how well the a/c unit kept the tent cool. Having the poles for a hammock near the fire pit was a plus. Cons:The location was less than ideal. Right next to the dump station, thankfully no one used it the night we were there. The glamping tents were not part of a camping loop and felt like they were just set up in a field. Every single person driving in has to drive by the first tent and is the second tent is 100% visible by just about everyone. The other sites are set up so the camper or vehicle can block the campsite from everyone.Since they seem to be just in a field the site is just sand and weeds instead of areas of pavement or gravel which I saw in other sites.",Sarah F,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Orlando,Florida,United States,Lake Louisa State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/10/2019,"Lake Louisa State Park is the perfect state park for those who want to escape in the beauty of nature with its lovely oak trees and seven lakes. It provides a scenic and serene place to come for a day or for a week because there are cabins that you can rent or great campsites available for renting for everything from tent camping to RV camping. If you want great activities then Lake Louisa is your go-to place. There are fabulous biking trails and horsebacking riding trails for guided rides. There are kayaks available and even kayak eco-tours. Canoes can be rented to use on the lakes within the park. Swimming in the lakes and enjoying the beaches and fishing in the lakes is fun too. Don't forget the hiking trails that are available through the lovely areas within the park. All great fun if you want to get active in ""the REAL FLORIDA"" and then relax later in the day on the serene tranquil beach. There are plenty of restrooms located throughout this very large state park and parking areas too. There are several docks (piers) located at the different lakes so that you can do out on them to fish.  The city of Clermont is nearby so you can stock up on picnic items and enjoy the picnic facilities at Lake Louisa for a nice picnic too.  Lake Louisa State Park has very helpful, friendly park rangers on duty at the park who can offer assistance to visitors. This park has so much to offer to couples or families or even singles who just want to just get away and relax. We love it and will be frequent visitors.",GaryandDenise2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lake Alfred,Florida,United States,Lake Louisa State Parktripadvisorreviews

7/7/2019,"We had a great time ‚Äúglamping‚Äù over July 4th weekend! We had a large canvas tent with queen size bed, linens, towels, inside lights, and seating area. It was just enough room for two people and our stuff. It was pretty impressive! We also had a portable AC unit, which was able to cool us enough at night to sleep. HOWEVER- for those thinking of doing this in the summer- it is unbelievably hot. You need to be out and about during the day vs in your tent. The AC unit cannot keep up with the heat during the day; it was not able to cool the tent until about 7-8 pm each evening. But that was to be expected in FL, and we will be back in the winter to go glamping again! We were also glad that we brought mosquito netting with us- a few mosquitos/gnats/moths will inevitably get into your tent at night and we strung up the netting around the bed- it worked perfectly (bring a bunch of binder clips). The glamping campsite is near the canteen, bathhouse and the other camp/RV sites. It was very quiet at night. Bathhouse was nice and clean- bring your own soap and toiletries. Toilet paper and paper towels were provided. Our campsite had a fire pit with two chairs, and a private covered pavilion with picnic table and grill- nothing fancy, but perfect for camping. You can buy firewood and charcoal from the canteen, or Publix is right down the road. The canteen also sold bags of ice and general supplies. The park has many nature activities to take advantage of. Many miles of hiking trails, paved bike lanes (brought our bikes-loved that!), kayak rentals, and horseback riding. We did the one hour horseback ride and that was enough- my butt and my legs were aching after that. We had a large riding group that day- I think it would have been better in a smaller group so that the guides could share the history and flora/fauna more easily. But I still enjoyed the experience as I hadn‚Äôt ridden in years- and horses are cool! If you need to get out of the heat (and you will in the summer), Clermont and Kississimee are ten minutes away in opposite directions, with everything you need, including movie theaters üòÅYou can book the glamping experiences on the Lake Louisa State Park website, on Air BnB or on VRBO.

Our guides (Mandi and Jordan) were phenomenal. Great personalities, super helpful and made the ride fun and enjoyable. We are not avid riders so an hour was the perfect length ride for us.

There are many hiking trails here - we did quite a few of them - not difficult and quite pleasant/cool in the trees.  The trails are really easy to navigate with good signposting.  Just wear comfortable walking shoes and cool layers.  At the lakefront there is a small beach/playground, picnic benches and BBQ pits.  Good clean restrooms and showers.  Within the park you can hire kayaks and bikes and take guided horse trails.  There's also a campground with full hookups, cabins overlooking one of the smaller lakes and even primitive camping.After we found this place, we returned a few times to cover more of the hiking trails.

We laughed a lot because our horses had a bit of an attitude as if to suggest ""Hey don't keep pulling on my bit, I'll stop when I get good and ready.""

There is a paved parking area, restroom, pavilion and paved trail to the large mound which are handicap accessible. There is an interpretive trail developed as an Eagle Scout project that is natural (sand and grass). This is a good place for birding and wildlife sightings depending on the time of year and time of day.  There are interpretive displacys along the path to the mound that help you understand the history of the site and the importance of the mound in its day.

We stayed at a pet friendly site, the bathrooms were older but clean, the campsite itself was high and dry. We were able to drive around the park and visit some of the attractions. The paddle boat ride was fun, although this time of year we didn't see many alligators. We were not interested in renting canoes, kayaks or bicycles. However, the rentals were not open for some reason. Personally I would NEVER kayak Myakka River. Too many alligators. Personal preference.

1/5/2020,"This was our first visit to Little Manatee River State Park.  While the park is large, there are only 30 campsites, so it is quiet and cozy.  Our site (3) was paved and level, but most sites are sand.  They have water, 50 amp service, grills and a fire ring.  Like most Florida State Parks, there is no sewer hook-up, my only gripe with park system.A new bathhouse was under construction, and a temporary unit was in place on site 21.  It was very cramped, but if you RV you‚Äôre probably used to it.  The biggest downside was there was only cold water to shower, and in January, that‚Äôs simply unacceptable.  I won‚Äôt ding the park for this, although wished they had better accommodations.  We simply took short showers in our rig.The trails we hiked, including the beautiful Oxbow trail, were wide and flat and well maintained. We saw a ranger digging up a trail root so that klutzes like me wouldn‚Äôt trip over them.  There are also several nice equestrian trails.  Although we didn‚Äôt get a chance to canoe, the river looked serene and inviting.  It is a typical Florida waterway, dark from tannins and lined with lush foliage.Besides hiking, biking and canoeing (isn‚Äôt that enough?), there isn‚Äôt a lot else to do at the park, but you‚Äôre not far from outlet shopping at Ellenton or going to the beach at Anna Marie Island if you tire of the outdoors or if the weather is bad.Bathhouse notwithstanding, this is a very nice park, with great trails, beautiful river views, nice staff and very good campsites.

First - if you're considering doing this hike, make sure you start at (google maps will find it by name):Little Manatee River State Park North Trail Head17837 US-301, Wimauma, FL 33598, USAThe hike is a stacked loop, so you can choose to cut it short and make it a 3 mile loop.  We did the entire 6 1/2 miles.  I would suggest you go counterclockwise so you'll see the river near the end.  The trail is very well built with lots of boardwalk sections, I assume where it would be wet during rainy season.  Every stream crossing had a bridge.  My GPS tracked a total elevation gain of 67 feet for the entire trail, so yeah - it's basically Florida flat.  We saw a couple of tortoises and an armadillo on the hike.  We also saw numerous (small) lizards.  The entire hike took about 2 1/2 - 2 3/4 hours at a leisurely pace.

5/7/2019,"One of the many places severely damaged by Hurricane Irma in September 2017, Long Key State Park is in the process of recovery and much of it is still under reconstruction. As with many of the mangroves in the Middle and Lower Keys, they were stripped bare and are mostly dead, thanks to the general area being Ground Zero for Irma's landing. But the park needs your help, needs the visitors, and it's still worth it, if only to visit a small spot discovered in the aftermath of Irma: a stretch of long-buried railroad from Flagler's days, with a few remnants of other rail-related treasures found. It's an exciting find, an exciting discovery of a link to the Keys past! The staff, the rangers, at the park are so welcoming, so friendly, and really are to be commended.

Go figure... The two hikes, the Eagle Trail and the Black Island Trail aren't extremely spectacular. They have an artificial feel to them and that's because the paths primarily lead along man-made ditches and canals.

8/10/2019,"This was an unplanned stop on a cloudy day and we are so glad we did this. $8 dollars to bring car in which at first we debated whether it was worth it. And now I don‚Äôt know why we debated it. Drove to first car park and got the tram to the beach where there are toilets and refreshments and much to my teenage children‚Äôs delight WiFi. We were not prepared to sit on the beach as my kids not interested (13, 15). We thought we would explore and walked on to the pier and try and spot dolphins and Manatees. Stunning views all around. We then walked back the way the tram brought us and stopped on numerous bridges for ages looking out to the water. Luckily on the last bridge we waited and spotted two dolphins playing they swam right under the bridge. Also a manatee popped its head up but you need to be Vigilant to see these.  We then got back into car and drove to furthest car park where you can pick up the trials. Unprepared for this we did not have the right footwear for walking far and only went in a little way. We came across snakes, lizards. Rabbits, and tortoise. And also be prepared mozzies they are persistent. Trials are wonderful and my kids who hate walking wanted to explore further (unheard of at home). Definitely worth a visit there are plenty of picnic ares if you bring your own food.

We observed a few at a distance as they broke the surface of the water but we didn't really see much.  It is a lovely place with the mangroves and birds.  On our way out of the park, we stopped for sodas at the state-operated shop.  The shop had a very limited selection of snacks so bring your own.  We hitched a ride to the beach (it's quite a walk).  It was the last ride out but the driver offered to return to pick us up in 15 minutes.  It was the perfect amount of time to stick our feet in the water and take some selfies.

There are wildlife observation  benches alongside the trails. There are manatees, a scattered gator or two, dolphins and many different species of birds and small mammals to observe. The facilities are modern and clean. There is a tram to take you from the parking area to the South beach. There is construction going on where the park is adding more facilities.

4/2/2019,"Visited Lover's Key State Park this past week... really enjoyed this beach!  There was a lot of parking past the small initial lot by the gift shop and the beach didn't feel too crowded at all for spring break... lots of families, very low key.  The beach was an easy walk across the bridge from the gift shop but the tram ride is helpful as well for getting small kids to the south end, where there's a place you can rent umbrellas + chairs (we had to keep south of the gazebo at the south end in order to rent them)  Am happy to report that the bathrooms at the south end tram stop has real plumbing, water fountains and changing tables - if you're a squeamish sort like me who's not adventurous about the portapotties or compost bathrooms.  We didn't buy any food but there seemed plenty available to buy.We rented kayaks at the state park and I'm leaving a rating short simply because I felt the desk really pressured us to kayak vs. paddle board, saying that we would see more / go further in kayaks, even though I really had my heart set on paddle boarding the estuary.  She said that paddle boarding was better at the beach (where it was really windy) and since you can't swim in the estuary, kayaks were better for resting.  Since we were kayaking elsewhere the next day, I didn't want to do it two days in a row but was really hoping to see manatees so opted for the kayaks.  Regrets, as the estuary was beautifully calm and manatees were sighted right off the launch... so paddle boards would have been just fine.  We saw most of the manatees on the bank just down and across from the launch spot, where there's a bridge and parking / viewing spot.. they seemed to like crowding around the bridge there for a sun bathe.  The rental shop posts if there's sightings which is helpful. We had a beautiful family day at this beach, well worth the trip.",adanek,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Los Angeles,California,United States,Lovers Key State Parktripadvisorreviews

There were multiple family pods and they get so close you can almost touch them. Beautiful and very peaceful. A huge bonus for us was as we left a family of 3 swam with us almost 2 miles before they swam out into the bay.We then walked the beach from the visitor center all the way around the southern tip almost to the dog beach. Lots of shells, dolphins, and enough friendly people to make it interesting but you could ignore everyone if you wanted and be all by yourself.Don't just stay on the beach near the visitor center.

Saw two small alligators in the water and one big alligator on bank sunning itself.  Wish it was a little more peaceful as traffic on Estero Blvd and planes flying overhead disturbs the serenity of the area.  You do have to transport your paddles, life vests, and seats from the gift shop area to the kayak/canoe launch area.  You can walk the half mile or figure out how to hold the paddles outside of your car and drive.  Would highly recommend wearing a swimsuit and bring clothes to change into.

There‚Äôs a gift shop and bathroom/ main area where you park, and they have a trolley out to the beach which is really nice because it‚Äôd be a pretty long walk otherwise. We spent most of our time on the beach, and even on a stormy day it was just stunning. There weren‚Äôt many waves and the water was crystal clear really far out so it made for a great day to find shells, and there was no shortage of shells to look at. I mean, in some areas they were literally just piled up like you would find snow piles in the north. Even found two whole, good-sized sand dollars! We walked all the way down to the end of the beach and back just looking around in the water and that was super fun and made the time fly by. At the end of the beach there‚Äôs some woody parts that are fun to look at and previous visitors have kind of decorated them with shells and I thought that was neat. I took a lot of pictures of the water because the colors were just break taking and so defined. You can also see Sanibel Island and the bridge over it from Lovers Key, just a lot of great views. There‚Äôs an option to rent kayaks and paddle boards and go along the mangroves which I‚Äôd like to come back and do at some point. They have bathrooms and rinse stations, and a small restaurant right on the beach as well, which a lot of SPs don‚Äôt and it‚Äôs nice to have everything you need yet it still feels mostly untouched by humans and it‚Äôs so quiet compared to other beaches.

A place we could have our ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner and dancing all on the sand under the Florida sky. We especially loved riding on the tram through the beautiful nature park that led to the beach where there was a huge gazebo right on the sand, perfect for dancing!From the initial visit, Amanda Reynolds was so helpful in providing us with all the information we would need to make a well informed decision - from recommended vendors, venue layouts, rental pricing, and sample invoices, she had it all ready for us! Amanda was truly phenomenal! She is so sweet and we quickly realized having her to organize and coordinate our wedding was INVALUABLE! She became my right-hand throughout the wedding planning process - working hand-in-hand with myself, our caterer and DJ to create a realistic timeline of events and venue layout. There were a few rental items I fell in love with and Amanda worked hard to secure them for our wedding - namely our white chiavari chairs and our beautiful four-post arch. She was so patient and accommodating and was a the key to making our wedding day run so smoothly. She guided us through our rehearsal and was there the day of to direct my wedding party down the aisle as well as coordinate all the vendors and ensure everything was set up in the correct place the day of the wedding. She even offered to set up our personal decorations on the day of the wedding. When our wedding day came, it was truly MAGICAL! Everything at the venue looked more beautiful than we ever expected! The set up was true to what we discussed and the decorations were so dreamy! Throughout the whole event Amanda was right there for anything we needed! She directed everyone down the aisle and took my husband and I by golf-cart to the driftwood for our photos. She went above and beyond her job description - even helping our photographer to pose us and bustling my dress before the reception. We had a special request for a fire entertainer to perform over dinner which had never been done at Lover's Key before. This was initially declined, but Amanda unexpectedly made it happen! We were overjoyed and our guests are still raving about the performance and our unique venue.So in summary - Lover's Key State Park was the PERFECT venue for the beach wedding of our dreams! Amanda will ensure your wedding day is as perfect as it can be by going above and beyond her job description. Thank you so much Amanda for all you did to make our wedding day so special and so perfect. You really took the stress off of us so we could have a magical and fun wedding day!",hnsjourney,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fort Myers Beach,Florida,United States,Lovers Key State Parktripadvisorreviews

3/27/2019,"On the way home from a business trip, I decided to visit this State Park for a paddle before I had to fly home. While the park itself was beautiful and the staff quite helpful, I hope the State Park reviews what the concessionaire is doing with the kayak rentals. The minimum rental period is 4 hours at $40. I arrived around 3:30pm on a hot, sunny day and was looking forward to decompressing on the water for a few hours. When I got to the rental counter, I was advised it was a ‚Äúlittle late‚Äù in the day, which puzzled me being hours from sunset. I asked what that meant and I was politely informed about the 4 hour minimum and that after completing the required paperwork and walking to the launch, I‚Äôd get an hour at most, as you need to be back by 4:45pm. Desperate for some peace on the water, after a long winter up north, I opted to proceed. I was already there and the environs were inviting. I asked if the money went to the Florida State Parks, which I‚Äôd feel better about. I was told no and that it goes to the concessionaire awarded this park‚Äôs contract. While I understand having a 4 hour minimum, once it passes 12:45pm, they really ought to offer an hourly rate, or a 3 hour & then a 2 hour rate, as the clock ticks forward. I understand wanting to maximize profit, but this is simply a flawed policy taking advantage of tourists. I enjoyed my brief time at the park and hope this review saves another tourist from this trap, if they arrive later in the day. Better yet, I hope the State Park reviews this policy. Paddle on.

While snorkeling I had a close encounter with a Manatee üòÉ. Scared the crap outta me as I have never seen one in real life. But it was an awesome experience. My wife and I also saw dolphins and some tarpon hunting fish. The next day we went it was a little busy and the water was too murky to snorkel.

7/28/2019,"We have visited this beach several times Dover the past four years.  Some years are better than others.  This trip we noticed that the water level was lower then before the water appeared less clear and a little on the green side.  If you are looking to find shells you are in luck. This beach is full of shells usually about two to three feet from the waters edge you will find a nice ridge of shells that were brought in to the beach during high tide. You are sure to find sand dollars , pelicans, fish and the occasional sting ray.  The park offers a tram that will take you out to the far end of the beach.  this runs continuously until 430pm Daily. Other wise there is a short foot bridge from the main parking area that gives access to the beach. There are other beach access points but we only park near the main one to rent paddle boards or get to beach.  There is a rent area that you can get bikes, kayaks, paddle boards, canoes . You can explore the estuary and see dolphins manatees, fish , alligators and other unique animals.  We were lucky enough this trip to see a small family of manatees . They came right up to our boards and out their heads on them . You can also rent paddle boards and boats at the beach to use in the gulf. Word of warning beware of the naked man on the far North End of the beach near the drift wood trees. We have encountered him now twice when enjoying the beach. This last time he was snorkelling naked. üò≥  so for parents of small kids I would recommend walking slightly ahead of the kiddos so they don‚Äôt see more then you would like. He usually is sitting back away from the water between some trees but not this time.  We unfortunately have photo proof of this from a couple years ago.

There were a lot of Gopher Turtles on the walk to the beach too.They have a Junior Ranger program which was a lot of fun for the kids.

We recommend taking the shuttle to the beach as the guide gives a history and description of the park.

11/25/2019,"Located on the south end of FMB- this is a place that we will return to many times.  $8 fee for a car to get in.  (TIP:  I would not recommend taking the tram. The tram drops you off very far from the entrance to the park. It would be a 20 to 30 minute walk from drop off to main park area, and on a hot day it would be very unpleasant.)We only had an afternoon here, but you could easily spend all day.  There are hiking & bike trails to explore.  Water channels that can be floated by kayak, canoe, or paddle boards.  Picnic areas scattered all over....   And of course a massive beautiful beach.We rented kayaks & paddled around for a couple hours.  We saw only a couple other people on the water & we spotted several manatees along the edges by the mangroves.  They do give you a map of the channels when you pay for the kayaks.  I believe it was $65 for a double kayak for 4 hrs.  So the prices were a little steep.  You can take your own if you live close.  (TIP:  you can drive from the place you rent the equipment to where you put in- you don‚Äôt have to walk.  We were told to walk, but it would‚Äôve been easier carrying everything if we had driven.  There is a parking lot right by the launch site.)Afterward, we spent a couple hours lounging on the beach.  Barely anyone was there, and the other beach goers were spread out so you felt like you were alone.  There is a tram that will take you from the parking lot to the beach & back to the parking lot.  It would be a 5-10 minute walk if you do not take the tram.  There is a place to rent chairs & buy concessions on the beach.  There are also bathrooms by the beach area.  But the beach is massive and goes as far as you can see in both directions, so depending on where you set up you might be farther from the bathrooms and concessions.The whole park was clean.

There are restrooms available and a free tram to take you to and from the beach.  We walked to the beach on a nice boardwalk.  The beach is really nice and not too crowded.  The day we were there, a free concert was scheduled in the gazebo on the beach.  We were going to stay for the music and get some food provided by a food truck, but it was a windy day and after a few hours of getting sand-blasted, we decided to leave.  We took the tram back to the parking lot which was quite full by then, I'm assuming because of the concert.  We didn't explore any more of the park that day, but hope to return before we go back home.  I will say though, the traffic on Fort Myers Beach heading back off the island was terrible.

We first hiked the Black Island Trail (2.6 mile hike). This trail goes right by the water almost the entire time which is unique, and it has several cut through if you don‚Äôt want to hike that much. We saw a gopher turtle and some other wildlife and interesting trees. We then hit the beach for 2 1/2 hours. The beach sand isn‚Äôt as nice as some of the Naples beaches, but it was way less crowded and had really great shelling there.

There are no chairs or anything at all on the beach, just Mother Nature, so if you intend to stay for a while you should probably do what some of the locals were doing and bring your own chair and beach blankets (and cold drinks). When we visited, there were several families with small children there, and some very serious sand castle construction was underway. Couples were strolling up and down the beach, picking up shells, and wading in the water. I am a seashell fan, and there were plenty to choose from. I had to make myself stop picking them up, turn around, and go back to our car because I just wanted to keep on walking on down the beach.

2/2/2020,"We spent the day at this State Park and really enjoyed it. We were staying in Fort Myers and found that it was easier to enter the park from the south from Bonita Beach rather than from the north at Ft Myers Beach.  Entering from the south means less traffic to deal with.There is an $8 / car charge to enter the park. There are three parking lots. The first parking lot is near the restrooms, gift shop and bike / kayak rental stand.There is a tram that will drive you and all of your belongings to the beach or you can choose to walk. The beach itself is beautiful. We walked from end to end.Additionally there are hiking trails that allow you to walk along the inland waterways, which is also where you would kayak.The kayaking trailing is 2.5 miles each way. It takes about 3 hours to complete. But there is a good chance you will see manatees.There are two hiking trails. One is 1.5 miles long and that goes on the inside of the canals.

We drove the main road basically to the end and found the trailhead, which was the start of a 2.5 mile loop if you follow the signs for the main path. Along the way there are shortcuts for anyone not wanting to be out there for all that time or distance. We actually ran the loop twice, once at a slower pace just so we could stop and enjoy the scenery. Once we finished with running, we spent the day on the beach. Fortunately, we didn‚Äôt have to lug our giant cooler all the way out to the beach, there is a tram that drives visitors the half mile out to the beach.

There is a fee to enter, but it's minimal: I think it was $8 per vehicle per day.We spent quite a while walking along the beach. It's gorgeous: very natural, and so many shells. There's also a few trees right along the shore that make for good photo ops, including a tree that people have decorated with shells! We did see a dolphin swimming in the ocean while strolling along the shoreline, along with pelicans.In addition to the beach, there's an estuary. You have to walk/ride over it via a bridge to reach the beach. When we were there, two dolphins put on quite the show immediately under the bridge! It was amazing. You can either walk to the beach, or take the free tram. When we first arrived, we walked to the beach. It's a very short walk to the middle section of beach. Later, we decided to take the tram to the south part of the beach, which is where the concession stand is located. That's a bit further, so we opted for the tram. It's a relaxing ride. At the south part of the beach, we ate lunch at the concession stand (overpriced for burgers they warm up in the microwave), and walked out on the fishing pier.It was going on 1:00 in the afternoon when we left, and it was starting to get really busy.

I've camped all over the country and have stayed at many places in Florida and have NEVER encountered as many ticks as I did during our weekend.  My mother, secure inside her RV, pulled 6 ticks off after taking a walk around the campground. They were literally falling from the trees.  I pulled several off my son when we got home.

The largest we‚Äôve seen to date, the springs are clear and wonderful in color.  There are multiple ways to enter to springs to swim if you choose to.  There is a boardwalk along the springs, out to the Suwannee River, where we saw our first manatee in the wild.

The bathrooms were ok.  There were multiple toilets & showers but they could be updated a little.  There is a washing sink outside for dishes as well.

5/26/2020,"We recently stayed at Manatee Springs state park on site 21 in the Magnolia Loop. We‚Äôve stayed in the park before so we knew what to expect.  Park is very well kept and there are deer everywhere.  Site 21 has a gravel pad and is fairly secluded with full hook-ups. Only issue with the site is that the sewer hookup was uphill from my drain and the site is a bit unlevel front to back, but not too bad.  There is no cell service (Verizon) and we only picked up 6 TV channels.  This was nice for me as we were able to really disconnect and go ‚Äúoff grid‚Äù for 5 nights.  The spring is nice and cool, great for a lazy float.  It will definitely cool you down on a warm day.  Due to Covid-19, the playground, boardwalk and concession were closed. When open the concession has great BBQ and the boardwalk takes you out to the Suwannee River.

We visited Manatee Springs because we were told the paddle launch area was easily accessible with a vehicle.There were also rentals available near the launch.At this location one can paddle in the spring run and in the Suwannee River, but not in the actual headspring, it is roped off for swimming.We enjoyed paddling in the spring run and a bit in the river. We did happen upon an alligator in the river, thankfully the alligator was chill and didn't seem to want anything to do with us. There are underwater caves in the spring run great for diving however we did not check this out.We did swim in the headspring. It was nice but the water was not as clear as other springs we visited (Poe, Ichetucknee, Rainbow, Three Sisters).If you are interested in more information about Manatee Springs and other area springs visit our blog site in our profile.

On most days there will be a manatee around to swim with or observe from a distance. Our family saw a cow with a calf and it was such a neat experience! There is a boardwalk down to the Suwannee River and it is full of natural sights. There is canoe, paddle boards and  pontoon boat rentals on site. Primitive camping and RV camping is available.

The dumpsters have been moved from the campsite areas to over by the dump station.

7/20/2020,"Manatee State Park is a true treasure for divers.  This is a well maintained, peaceful  State Park that definitely cares  about the environment and the wild life.  You need to get there early if you are diving because they limit the number of open water divers to 18 and cave divers to 8.  I have been bringing open water classes here for several years.  We always show up about 15 minutes before 8  AM when the gates open and we've never been denied entry.  Best part its only $6  for admission!They have a clean restroom facility and an adjacent snack bar which serves hot food including BBQ.   You can make a nice dive in Manatee to a depth of about 30 feet before the cave starts. Because of the high magnitude flow it stays silt free.  Another equally fun dive is across the property at Catfish Hotel.  You have to dive through the duckweed to get to the sink but it's a great dive to a deeper depth to 60-70 ft.  When you come out they have a shower beside the spring to wash off yourself and your gear.  They also have picnic tables and grills with plenty of room.  The place is never crowded.  The only negative thing is that you have to walk several hundred yards to the springs from the parking area.  We take a small garden cart so that we can pull everything down to the springs to suit up.  I've seen manatee in the spring during Winter months and plenty of fish at all times of the year.    You might even see a gator or two!  I highly recommend Manatee to anyone who loves Spring diving.",Kim,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Goose Creek,South Carolina,United States,Manatee Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

Lots of nearby birds all around in the trees and on the swamp.   There was a Seminole early-life demonstration area the day we visited with lots to learn.  All in all, a very nice park.

3/21/2019,"The campground is pretty nice.  However, navigation may be an issue in some sites, but we didn't notice any excessive slope in any sites.  Like a lot of parts, some sites are pretty close to each other with little privacy.That said, don't be surprised when the deer come marching through your site.  Due to scheduling, we stayed in two sites and the deer came through at least twice a day at both sites.The boardwalk by the spring is nice and you're likely to see a few snakes, gators, turtles, and manatee (depending on the season).If you have the time, this is a nice area to canoe/kayak.  The spring empties out into the Suwannee River.  While it may not always be the case, we didn't have any problem with a strong river current; however, we stayed within a hundred or so yards of the shore to watch for wildlife and gators.",Billy K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Livingston,Texas,United States,Manatee Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

The boardwalk is a joy, and the riverside trees are lovely. There was various other wildlife about - we even saw an armadillo busily going about its armadillo business, which apparently was eating. You can walk out to a pier well into the river, from which the manatees are said to be frequently seen, and enjoy nature at peace.

1/26/2020,"Had a goal of seeing manatees in the wild on a January trip to Florida.  Decided to try this park as a stop on my way further south.  it's about 55 minutes off of I75, but worth it.  I had my three dogs with me, so wanted to get them out for a nice walk after LOTS of drive time.  Lots of people also had dogs with them, milling about.  A bit disappointed when got to the park, as it appears dogs are only allowed on one very short trail, according to the map.  Not gonna lie, I chose to not see a tiny sign and took them for the most lovely walk on Chief trail, Loop Trail and one other back there that I forgot the name of.  Sad that more people don't take advantage of such a lovely trail system and only stay up near the hot springs.  In two hours, I only saw 8 people spread out over three groups.  Trails are easy to walk--very flat & sandy, but do watch your step for roots are easy to trip over.  Weather was perfect this day.  Maybe the park could do a little more to promote the nice trails by listing the features of each on their website or map...I.e. Chief trail has little markers along it pointing out natural features, an example of a Chickaee Indian house is featured here, etc etc.  After two hours of walking and decompressing, headed back to the parking lot to drop the dogs off and then took the boardwalk out to the river.  Boardwalk is nicely maintained and scooters/wheelchairs are able to navigate it so can experience it too.  I got to the end and started looking out south and west.  Disappointed as didn't spot any manatees there, so was like ""oh well, at least its pretty"".  And then I heard a large exhale coming from behind me!  Well, there they were, maybe 30 feet off the dock to the north, luxuriating in the outpouring of the hot spring!!!  Two close ones, three further off!  How bout that!  Goal achieved!  They aren't the most exciting creatures to watch, as they just kind of hang out there but what an idyllic and relaxing setting!  Looks like it has lots of RV parking which would be a lovely place to just hang out and chill for a few days.  Lots of groups taking advantage of the picnic tables for birthday parties/family gatherings in a nicely maintained, clean area & kids playing on the playground.",FastWhiteDog,5.0 of 5 bubbles,AgilityWestie,AgilityWestie,AgilityWestie,Manatee Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

Though the house was not open for tours due to COVID-19, we had a nice conversation and learned a lot from a volunteer, and were able to look in all the doors and windows. The whole place is very interesting, I can see the how inspiration for ""The Yearling"" came from here. Sitting in the yard, I was able to imagine how life was in Florida those many years ago. No A/C. No indoor plumbing early on. A sprawling house designed in part to let the air in and through it. The orange grove. All very magical, down to the chickens and ducks roaming. We took the two paths/trails. Though they were nothing special, it was nice to walk in the Florida woods, even if it was in the Florida heat.We also made use of the next-door county park and boat ramp. We had our picnic lunch on a picnic table in a wide open area under a huge, huge oak tree. With a gentle breeze, the mid-80s temps were certainly bearable, what a nice setting.

This may be due to a lack of funding, but it is not up to the standards of other State Parks or Historic Areas. The automobile will soon be nothing but a pile of rusted metal.

I recommend reading Cross Creek before you go. I was only familiar with The Yearling and had no interest in reading such a heartbreaking story. However, our guide often referenced things around the home and events that occurred at the home that Marjorie wrote about in Cross Creek.

If you so choose, there's a picturesque boat launch nearby, as well as picnic tables, grills, and a children's play area. You don't have to take the tour, but without it, you'll miss out on the entire story.

6/4/2019,"After moving to the south a while back we started to hear the word 'Cracker' and Florida 'Cracker' a lot.  And as much as you can read about this term and it's references it has been a wish to experience a true 'Cracker' homestead.  And through the generosity and life of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings we have now had the pleasure.  What a delightful little side trip to this interesting part of Florida and a great introduction to the writer of The Yearling.  The house is of course charming, full of her original furnishings returned to the location by her second husband after it was deeded to the state.  Certainly a glimpse into what is always called a simpler way of life the tour guide was anxious to tell of her stories and her visitors the likes of Gregory Peck and Robert Frost.

The guide just went over the basics, never mentioned the staff cabin or took us down the path in the woods which previously was very interesting.

9/18/2019,"I experienced a sleepless night and awoke in a sweaty mess, heart pounding and guilt-ridden over the need to keep this tranquil, Florida wildernesses a secret. The park has the ‚ÄúLake View‚Äù loop with the more desirous sites overlooking the lake:  74, 73, 72, 71,70,69 and 68. Honorary mentions go to 61,62,63,64,65,66 and 67. The rest of the sites in this loop were very open and in some instances cramped too close to each other for my liking. The restrooms were spotless. Now here is where it gets difficult for me, the ‚ÄúSandhill‚Äù loop is a true gift that makes you pounder how much God must love us! Credit must also go to the Architects that designed this section of the park. A lot of thought and consideration obviously went into it. The tent loop captured the beauty that Florida wilderness is. I must point out not one plane, airboat, automobile or radio interrupted the delicious peaceful quiet. The sounds of nature abounded with the rustling of the leaves the occasional bird song and the gentle breeze on your face. I got to view the interior of one cabin. It is truly a step back in time when life was less complicated and simpler, where the focus was not on your material possessions but on the closeness of your family and your friends. They are very modest small and clean accommodations but with nothing lacking (except a TV) this state park will remain a favorite as long as I appreciate nature for what it is and leave the hectic life and world we live in.

3/15/2020,"My wife and I visited this park recently. We mostly enjoyed our experience, with one exception which I will explain later. We initially did the canopy walk which was fun, as well as climbing up to the top tower-great views from there. When we arrived at the reception center and the lake, we signed up for the boat ride and tram ride combo. The boat ride was interesting, took about an hour and we spotted quite a few alligators  both basking in the sun and in the lake. The boat captain, Matt, was very informative and knowledgable. After the boat ride,which was over at 3 p.m., we had an hour and a half before the tram ride, so we had lunch and then explored the board walk to the bird sanctuary, where are numerous varieties of birds. After this, we went back to the tram tour departure, which was due to leave at 4.30. This was the problem, as we waited from 4.15  to about 4.40, with no sign of any tram! Amy, the only remaining employee from the ticket office, advised that the tram driver had left early-she managed to expedite a refund to us, which took a few minutes.

There is a boardwalk that takes you out to the water where you can see a variety of birds in their natural habitat. The park ranger has a powerful set of binoculars you can use. The ranger we met was extremely knowledgeable and had so many interesting facts about the birds we were viewing.

6/10/2019,"After so many good reviews our visit was disappointing. $32/adult and $26/children 3-12 for combo boat tour and tram. Tours ran only every 2 hours. There was a long car line to get into the park and we arrived at 1:01pm for the boat tour. Our tardiness was made into a big deal with my 6 y/o daughter getting shouted at and the captain saying ""oh geez"" on the microphone upsetting other riders.  Despite my daughter already sitting on the boat we opted to forgo this embarrassing situation and do the next tour at 3pm.  The boat ride is an hour so it wasn't like we were going to make subsequent rides late.  Apparently they changed contracts recently and prior it was an airboat tour.  This was not worth our money we saw one alligator.  Unlike an air boat we did not get close to the shore. The tram ride was more pleasant hence the 2 stars.  You get to see a part of the park you would never otherwise see. Hindsight we should have just refunded our tickets but even the lady at the window was unsympathetic. It was as if they didn't care about customer service or supporting the State Park despite promoting membership and donations.

Having said that,  we enjoyed our visit as always, although we still cannot see the logic of changing the old airboats,  for two boats with outboard motors.

Pink Gator Cafe serves pretty decent food like gator bites and delicious alligator stew ($$). Or you can bring your own picnic basket. We came back a second day to go specifically to the Deep Hole where hundreds of alligators hang out. The Preserve (across the Park) only allows 30 permits (free) per day so you hv to be there b4 Park opens to get in line. We were there at 8am n got #26 & #27. It's an approx 2.5 miles to the Deep Hole but definitely worth going. We saw abt 50-70 alligators there, what a treat.

Unfortunately, the lady who worked the admission window was unfriendly, unhelpful and overwhelmed in her position.  Even though it wasnt' very busy, we were unable to purchase tickets because she was unable to manage her job effectively.  I suspect this was just one person having a bad day.

Captain Matt Reid on the boat and a very nice lady (don't know her name, sorry) on the tram tour were both wonderful speakers.  Captain Reid told of his interesting experiences and knowledge of the wild & creatures.  The 10:00 tram tour guide taught about what it was like to be a pioneer settling in the park, as well as some of the history.  Also explained about the controlled burns to keep the Florida ecosystem in check.  These tours would be good for youth, I would think.

The dock, store, cafe, ice cream, tram tour , bike rentals, boat tour are all at this one section.  We had a dog with wasn't an issue, but when walking along the edge of the water, we were cautioned that there was an issue - at another part of the park, where a alligator did catch and killed a dog.

2/27/2021,"WORST PARK MANAGMENT AWARD OF THE YEAR........ We planned a trip for weeks.. Spent hundreds on camping/hiking gear.. changed schedules at work, paid to have pets kennelled....  drove hours to the park only to be told that they cancelled out resdervations the morning of our planned scheduled weekend hike..  No call and they said they called that very morning.. No call... Regardless... we had reservations, plans.. spent a fortune for this weekend and they decided that very morning that they would do a BURN and we would have to find other arraingments.   They didn't offer us a camp site, a cabin, or another spot at another site on the trail.  They just said OH WELL YOU ARE OUT.....  I said WHAT THE F>>> and they hung up on me.  This is the worst case of customer relations I have ever seen.. Weeks and hundreds planned on this weekend and they don't give a rats a....ss about people.  I am behond upset and pissed off.  And the ranger on the phone.. She is one nasty person.. No effort to figure it out for us.. Hundreds and hundreds of acres of land and they can't help us find a place to hike and camp.  The other hiking sites were all open, so the scheduled burn couldn't have been that big.. And why would you take our reservations and then wait until last minute to tell us they are doing a planned burn and that we are f###Ked and to go someplace else.????

There were children on board! The rest of the staff we encountered was so pleasant (thank you Evy!) and we really did enjoy the park immensely but that man has no business representing your park & certainly doesn‚Äôt belong anywhere near your paying customers.

(I've always been fond of more). $6 for two of us, it's just like Florida was a hundred years ago. The outlook is part of the canopy walk and is included in the price of admission. It's worth stepping up over 70 feet to see miles of nothing but nature and a peek at a highway miles away. I'm going back to see more birds. This time it was rosette spoonbills, great egrets, (they have a big ego), cattle egrets, limpkins, and anhingas; not to mention the vultures that work hard to keep the park clean. Sure there are plenty of alligators too! To see them go when it's cold; they'll climb out of the water to get some sun.

We took a walk and the other side where there are larger campers, and the facilities are completely re done, and a lot nicer.  I guess big camper side is the way to go.

The boat was packed and you could barely experience anything about the lake.  In addition the sound system was garbled so you couldn't hear the commentary.  We were very disappointed.

It was well-built and is sturdy. No fears from any in our party. One of the best features of our cabins was the log fireplace that made the December evenings cozy and warm.

They have places for pic nic and parties. Remember you are on your own and dont play with the wild animals.

6/4/2019,"Myakka River State Park is a not to miss Florida State Park. Don't let the proximity to Sarasota Fool You! It is very close to Sarasota which makes it a good stop if you are visiting the area or an outstanding stop if you are from out of town as you can enjoy a little bit of Surf and Turf. As a Sarasota local who loves the outdoors, I've visited most of Florida's State Parks and this is one of my favorites for sure. We tend to neglect what we can do and see everyday and this is no exception. I'm always amazed. This time we camped out for the weekend even though we live about 10 miles away and we have never felt so far from home while being so close. Probably my first ""staycation"".You can paddle, hike, ride or just chill in this really large state park. Super clean and well run. All the staff are really nice and you can tell they enjoy being there. This park is the real deal and you will feel you are in another world. Get out and explore! Sidebar: A lot of people ask me why I share my favorite ""secret"" places with total strangers and the answer is that the very best places everywhere are under tremendous pressure from growth, development and environmental pressure.

Since we live it Ft Myers, I decided to make a quick trip to check out the park. If you don't like palmettos, live oaks and spanish moss or quiet strolls through marshes and meadows then perhaps this is not the destination for you. But if, like me, you enjoy all the beauty nature has to offer, then this park will be right up your ally! Hiking, biking, boating, kayaking, birding and more, this park has it all! You are also free to bring your dog, but they must be on a leash. So much to see and do! There are over 4000 Alligators in the park so keep your eyes peeled when strolling along the wetlands.

On an overcast day the tickets for the boat and tram tours sell out quickly so get there EARLY.  We had to wait 2 hours even though they were running every hour that day (our fault!) We felt lucky to score tickets.  The canopy is nice too.  Lots to see and do.  I was frustrated on the boat tour when a 3 or 4 year old kept standing on the seat and leaning over the railing with gators everywhere.  Everyone on our end of the boat was on edge, my husband spoke up and then so did I because it would have been us jumping in - one of the guardians couldn‚Äôt even swim!  Wish the boat operator had addressed the situation instead of us having to,as it sort of put a damper on things.

On the 7 mile scenic drive, I stopped at a few places, to walk on a trail, and to see alligators or birds. The alligators were plentiful and very close to the roads. The trail to the canopy walk was pretty short. The suspension bridge is 25 feet above ground, is very narrow, and I think it said maximum of three people allowed at a time. The gift shop was very nice. Although I did not order any food from the caf√©, it looked good. I did not go on the boat ride or tram tour.

7/25/2019,"A five-foot alligator recently was discovered in Chicago's Humboldt Park lagoon. Guess who they called to rescue the alligator and bring it back to Florida? A ranger from Myakka River State Park. There are lots of alligators there. Myakka River State Park, located nine miles east of I-75 and Sarasota, Florida, consists of 37,000 acres and is one of the largest parks in the state. It also is one of the oldest, having been established in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. While alligators abound in the park, there also are wood storks, blue herons, black-necked stilts, great egrets and other rare birds. There also are many species of fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. Also pine forests, scrub, prairies and wetlands. One interesting site is Deep Hole, a karst sinkhole located on the northwest bank of the Myakka River in the Wilderness Preserve. It is 41 meters deep. Visitors can take advantage of boat tours, picnic areas, canoeing, camping, hiking, cycling, walking, jogging, horseback riding and skating. A good portion of the park is accessible by automobile. The main road, a 6.5-mile drive between the north and south ends, leads to a boardwalk to the river and a lake that is excellent for bird watching. In addition, a short walk from the main road leads to Myakka's Canopy Walkway, a novel suspension bridge and tower that provides visitors with views of the forest canopy and a spectacular above-the-treetops view of the entire park. But be sure to avoid the alligators. This isn't the Humboldt Park lagoon.",Taylor B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Chicago,Illinois,United States,Myakka River State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/2/2019,We spent an afternoon here.  If you are up to walking that is the best way to fully experience the park. The trails are well marked with sitting areas to observe the wildlife. Climb the tower and jostle along the suspension footbridge. Great for the kids to stride out ahead and explore. If you'r not wanting to stretch your legs it is a lovely drive and you just may see alligators basking from the bridge like we did. There's a park office exhibit area that gives background to what you will see.

We saw more birds from the shore before the boat ride and only spotted one alligator sunning itself on the shore line.

After we got on the tram, we found out that they were burning fields and couldn't go on the regular route. The tour guide did her best to make it interesting, but I was disappointed that we had to stay on the regular roads that we could drive on ourselves. Maybe next time, inform guest ahead of time that changes had to be made to the route before tickets were purchased. Next, we went to spend some time at the canopy walk. It was blocked off and three police cruisers were parked there. Don't know what was going on. Next we went to take the boat ride, which we have done several times before. Very disappointed... Before the trip was relaxing and very enjoyable. This time we were glad for it to end. I believe the captain was trying to make it fun, but it was way too hyped, loud, and too much about him for us. We were looking for relaxing. It may appeal to younger guests. He is very knowledgeable, but we wouldn't go again if he was doing the trip. Just being honest and I hate to be negative.

3/16/2020,"We visited Myakka while visiting Sarasota based on the recommendations of some local friends. There are a number of choices of walking areas. He first headed for the Canopy Walk - we climbed the lower tower, crossed the walk (which swings a bit!), and then some of use climbed the taller tower. The views are nice (treetops, etc) but not great.The towers and the walkway are not really ""in"" the treetops. Upon reaching the ground, we took a nice 40 minutes walk on a path near the canopy walk, which made its way back to the parking lot.  After this, we drove to a waterfront area (with toilets, store, cafe) and walked along the water - at the end of the walk (about 20 minutes)next to the water we could see a lot of birds and (large) alligators - the highpoint of the day.",Herb M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Rockport,Massachusetts,United States,Myakka River State Parktripadvisorreviews

2/19/2020,"While we did not see much on the Boat Tour, I would still recommend it.  Reasonably priced at $20 per adult, the guide's information about the park and its inhabitants well worth the price of admission.   And being out on a boat on a beautiful day was just fine with us.   Too windy for the alligators, unfortunately.    We leisurely drove from one end of the park to the other and looked for more wildlife.  A lot of birds, herons, ibis, pelicans.  The park rangers were all knowledgeable and informative, without shoving education down your throat.    Our boat guide also suggested some spots to find alligators back out on the main road and he was spot on!",Connie B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Chicopee,Massachusetts,United States,Myakka River State Parktripadvisorreviews
4/18/2019,We didn't know that the largest airboat which we loved had been retired and replaced with 100 passenger pontoon boat power with twin outboards.  A new company has taken over so our half price tickets saved from last year were no longer honored.  Furtermore the ride has been increased from $14 to $20 per person.  To add insult to injury we saw no gators that would normally be on the river banks.  The park is still a beautiful place to visit but the boat ride is not the same so I have reduced my rating to 3 stars instead of 5 stars.,Reviewer1939,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Boston,Massachusetts,United States,Myakka River State Parktripadvisorreviews

3/6/2020,"We had a very pleasant day exploring Myakka State Park. We started at the bridge looking for alligators and birds. Be sure to bring your binoculars! A short way down the road is the trail to the Canopy walk. Climb the steps to reach a 76 foot observation platform where you view the tree tops and Myakka River basin. Our next stop was the gift shop. They have lots of interesting souvenirs for you to spend your money on. There is also a snack bar with food and drinks. Once we had shopped and used the restrooms, we ventured over to the weir looking for more alligators and birds. Our favorite siting was the roseate spoonbill! Our last stop was the bird walk where we saw birds, a wild boar, and more birds, incuding an eagle perched in the flatlands next to the river! The park is beautiful and a great spot for birdwatching.

A naturalist comes to the boardwalk around 9:00 with a scope.  We were met by a red-shouldered hawk who posed nicely for pictures.  In the distance we could see wild pigs!  A lot of shore birds were in the water.  We saw four young eagles up close as they hunted in the water and then sat in the grass not far from us. The second time we went down by the weir/dam.  It was a short walk and well worth the trip.  Spoonbills, gators, blue herons, great egrets, and many more. You were right on the bank of the river and they were right in front of you!  Great for pictures.  There is no place to sit in this section, but the boardwalk had a bench.  A lovely park, lots of people camping.

The bridge isn't as high as I thought it would be but you cross it and then climb a wood stepped observation tower to above the trees. Pretty views. There are bugs to deal with but we had applied bug spray so weren't too bothered. We also stopped in an area where we were able to view alligators in the water. We went to the bird walk and did observe several different types of birds.

1/4/2021,"My boys and I love the Jr Ranger programs the parks have to offer and Myakka has been our list for some time now. We couldnt have picked a better day - cool, slight overcast skies. Just perfect. We started our vist with a scenic boat ride. We knew the boats launched on the hour and we got to the park around 1. It was perfect timing, allowing time for crowds and to complete all of the waivers.We boarded our boat with Captain Matt. His welcome was warm and jovial, which put the kids and moms at ease. Captain Matt was an incredible and hospital guide - he not only incorporated the ecological impression of Myakka but the deep history from the area. My boys were amazed at how much they learned, and it‚Äôs hard to impress 11 yr olds. We saw lots of alligators and many of the species of birds that call the park home. Captain Matt made it a point to get up in those spots that made for the best views and sites. I highly recommend taking the time to board the Queen of Myakka and let Captain Matt take you for a ride. We rounded out our visit at the Canopy walk - it was breathtaking. My boys and I felt like we were looking down at the canopies of a rain forest. It was amazing. Breathing in the air and looking out for miles and miles of beautiful terrain - it made for a beautiful end to our Sunday. Thank you Myakka for a wonderful visit.

10/22/2020,"I drove out to Myakka for a change of scene during Covid isolation. Perhaps my mistake was going on such an oppressive hot & humid Florida day. I did a short walk to the Canopy Walkway, which is nothing special, especially since the observation tower at the end is closed due to Covid. I decided to pay $20+ for a boat tour, but since the captain said he didn't believe in masks, and he was speaking near me for the entire tour (honestly, he didn't stop yakking for a second), I felt uncomfortable the entire time.

The airboat ride is now a boat ride which is very disappointing. I don‚Äôt know how a family can afford to go there other than just walking around to see the sights. It has really gone downhill in our opinion, not fun anymore. We don‚Äôt care about the food, because they only have junk food.

11/16/2019,"When I first visited this park a few years ago, I was amazed by its massive footprint of largely undisturbed wildlife habitat.  As a nature lover and amateur photographer, I was provided with seemingly endless views of so many alligators, anhingas, spoonbills, kestrels, deer, raccoons, squirrels, turkeys, wild hogs, ... the list goes on. Riverside sunsets are their own reward, especially from the main bridge.  I have since become a continuous annual-pass holder.  As such, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to discover that Myakka River State Park is a different awesome experience every couple of months.  Due to the shallow topography, much is determined by water levels of the river.  Small depth changes will either reveal or conceal considerable land acreage. This impacts both behaviors and locations of the wildlife.  Hands down, this is my favorite park in Florida.

The man in the rental place asked a few times if we were sure and of course I kept saying NO and my husband said YES!  It took a little convincing for me to get out there, but guess what?  I did it and, yes, I was petrified, but after a little while I really enjoyed it.  The man at the rental place said I did so well that I deserve an ice cream!  Ha Ha....and yes my husband bought me one too!   We saw so many beautiful birds, a few lazy alligators that pretty much went right into the water when we got a little close.  We really enjoyed our afternoon and I can now check off canoeing with alligators off my bucket list!! All I can say is this place is awesome and every time we visit we see something new and exciting.

2/5/2020,"Visiting State parks is one of our favorite things to do on vacation, so we could not pass up a chance to visit Myakka River State Park.  What a great experience we had there!  This park is one of Florida's largest and most diverse natural areas.  It includes the beautiful Myakka River, wetlands, prairies, pine lands and hammocks, as well as a huge variety of wildlife.  We wanted to learn about the history of this jewel of a park, so we started with a Tram Tour.  Our guide was very knowledgeable and treated us to a fascinating history of the park as we traversed the land.  It really was amazing to see how drastically the landscape changed as we went from the lush wetland to the much dryer prairie area.  In a matter of a few minutes we saw completely different types of trees and grasses.  All along we were treated to numerous viewings of the animal we really came to see:  the alligator.  They were big, beautiful and fascinating.  We were reminded that they are dangerous and we needed to keep our distance and be mindful of their presence.  Of course, birds were abundant in this welcoming space and we had many wonderful sightings.  We continued learning about the park with a delightful Boat Tour.  Being on the water gave a different perspective and even more insights into the richness of this place.  Myakka River State Park was a highlight of our visit to the Sarasota area.

3/22/2020,"We had a wonderful day at Myakka River State Park today.   We took our bicycles and had a pleasant ride along the roads and paths of MRSP.  There are many cars but all share the roads pretty well.  We went out on the bird walk platform and saw a large flock of white pelicans, an osprey fishing over head and many other species of migratory and resident birds.   Then we rode back to the boat launch area and walked back a trail to see dozens of alligators basking in the sun.   We then had a nice picnic lunch in the picnic grove.  We biked again and saw two huge alligators in a very small wadi obviously impressing each other for ‚Äúromance‚Äù?? A sight that you would only see on a Animal Planet nature show.  Along the path we also saw wildlife of all kinds.

You can even get  a dish of ice cream if you finish your ride before the food concession closes.There are many miles of nice uncrowded, mostly shaded roads in the park for leisurely bike rides with plenty of beautiful Florida scenery. There is a nice lake with an elevated bird viewing platform and we saw many interesting and beautiful bird species.  HINT: take your binoculars to see the birds even better.We also parked our bikes and stood in the middle of the river bridge to view several really big alligators.

3/27/2019,"We drove down from Madeira Beach to see this state park and we had a great time.  Once you get to the park, make your way to the visitor center so you can get a map and ask the ranger how to plan your day.  It‚Äôll make things easier for you.  We went on a short 3/4 mile nature hike that is easy for all ages.  The trail is flat and easy to walk.  You can start off by going to the canopy tower that overlooks the entire park.  Once you are done with that you can take the nature trail hike that loops back to the parking lot.  The park offer boat rides so you can see the alligators on the north side of the lake.  I would recommend the boat ride; it was informative and you will see a lot of gators.  We probably saw 50 or so.  There is a fee of course for the boat tour.I would plan on being there 3-4 hours (unless you decide you want to camp over night).",scottfromerie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Erie,Pennsylvania,United States,Myakka River State Parktripadvisorreviews

Matt was our guide on the boat ride, and he admitted up front that we probably wouldn't see many alligators or other wildlife due to the recent heavy rains and the time of the year.  However we did spot one alligator on the shore and then two or three more in the water.  We saw so many beautiful types of birds and got some great photos.  Matt told us about the history of the lake at the state park as well as his family's connections to the park.  Our guide for the tram ride was Robert and he was very knowledgeable about the plants and trees of the park.  We also got to see a deer and a very large alligator.  Robert also told us a lot of the history of the park, which of course we had already heard on the boat ride, but it was interesting nonetheless.  We were able to walk around some flooded trails to get to the canopy walk, which was really nice but not as high or as long as we had imagined it to be.  The 74 ft tower was closed (I am guessing due to COVID) so we didn't get to see that.  Next time we are in the area and come to the State Park we will come prepared to hike and bike as we hear that the trails are incredible.

9/8/2020,"Ranger Brock took our entrance fee - $4, and it was well worth it! When we first entered we saw two deer. We did not drive the scenic road as it was open only to Rangers. Signs are everywhere, asking visitors to follow social distancing guidelines and to avoid crowds. We didn‚Äôt see too many campers, and the sign at the entrance indicated that the campground was full, so they are limiting capacity. Today we drove to the parking area by the river. Longer trails start here. We only wanted a mile or less round trip trail, so we drove to the boat ramp, past the campsites. The River Trail starts here, .7 miles each way. We walked 1.2 miles round trip. We saw butterflies and bobwhites. We also visited the bathrooms, which have showers, too. Water fountains, a sink, bulletin board, and pet station are outside this comfort station. Both bathrooms are cleaned daily between 10:30-11:30. This is where we will return to camp for meteor showers! It has no lights, except at the bathrooms, and I think it is $18 a night. We are over 65, so I think we get it for 50% off.

There is plenty of area to ride a bike as well.  The camping area is near one of the rivers and my suggestion would be if you are in a tent don't go when it has been raining because of the water that collects there.

The campground here is not really designed for large motor homes or 5th wheels, but if you have a travel trailer, pop up or tent, it's perfect.  The restrooms and showers are clean and well stocked.  Families do camp here, so sometimes there is noisy activity, but the 11 pm deadline for quiet is respected.  A full time attendant lives in the campground and makes sure nothing gets our of hand.  Take a nighttime walk down the trail next to the river and see the deer playing on the bank.  The piebald (partially white) deer that live here are uniquely gorgeous, as are the playful white squirrels.  If you like fishing or kayaking you won't be disappointed.  There is a nice fishing pier, kayak launch and boat ramp in the park.

Then they complain that there isn't enough room to maneuver or that the roads were rough? This is CAMPING. There is tons of land at this state park, my complaint is that everyone is confined to this tiny space and any camping experience is ruined by people with no respect for others by their need to stay up all night talk /socialize etc. If a few ""back country"" tent only campsites were made away from this trailer park, the place would be much better.",ski,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Newnan,Georgia,United States,Ochlockonee River State Parktripadvisorreviews
3/31/2019,"Several local museums do a very good job of telling the story of the Seminole Wars in the 1800's as colonizers attempted to claim the land in Florida. However, the State of Florida parks system needs to do better. The acreage remains natural much as it was in the 1800's. However, no visitor to the area would have any idea of the historical significance unless you went to the bathroom. There is one page of a multi page document, which partially describes the history of the battle, placed in a glass case on the toilet facility, the only structure in the park. The reenactment of the battle occurs in February annually when the battle actually occurred the day after Christmas. There is no mention of the Tribal influence in this town except the town's name itself, but there are plenty of things named after Zachary Taylor, the military officer who lured Tribal leaders in this battle and subsequent battles, even the famous Osceola, with a white flag of truce only to arrest the Seminole when they came out to acknowledge the flag and accept Taylor's surrender.

Wonderful day-hiking around the river, cool suspension bridges, swimming in the river, picnic tables (many covered). And massive grass areas.  Of course there are swings and playgrounds for the little ones.  The park is large enough to accommodate many people, a RARE occurrence, while still keeping your visit private.  Ample close by parking and overall beautiful scenery.  In our view the park is under-utilized.  The facilities are adequate, a bit dated and in need of maintenance/upgrades like so many parks.

8/5/2020,"We love the state parks in general and this is definitely a must-see! It's one of the older parks so it has more buildings and infrastructure  (built in the '30s but the CCC) than many of the newer parks. Many of the buildings were closed because of Covid, but the important facilities like bathrooms were still available. There's extensive hiking, a swimming area, boat launch, picnic spots and a playground so there was still plenty to do. We camped in the Dogwood Campground which was great. The sites are a little harder to back into if you have a larger camper/RV because the road is narrow but they're also very private. The bathhouse is in great shape and was very clean. When we booked, I didn't realize that there are two seperate campgrounds and that Dogwood is over a mile from the hiking area, river, and dumpsite. Not a deal-breaker by any means, but I think next time we'd stay at the Magnolia campground instead.",Liz D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Key West,Florida,United States,OLeno State Parktripadvisorreviews
5/30/2020,"Park is beautiful.  Main attraction is the swimming area and rustic remains of the original town of Keno which became O'leno.  There is a swimming area in the river and a walk through the forest along the river to the place where the river goes underground, all very interesting.   There are an abundance of ticks, chiggers and mosquitos.  Area is very humid and this makes it uncomfortable if temperatures goes above 85.   We decided to camp here having visited other FSP campgrounds.   The campgrounds here are sandy with a clay being introduced to park.  When it rains the campsites flood and sand sticks to the bottom of feet and shoes making your tent or camper gritty, sites should have paved area or gravel to make them more comfortable  Cooking areas are fire-pits in the ground - making it hard to cook or even light coals as the pit is moist at all times.  There is no camp store and Magnolia camp is closest to the attraction, but still a hike.  We brought our dogs (18 and 30 lbs) and there was no place to let them off the leash.

The CCC built the park in the 1930s and many of the buildings and the suspension bridge remain from that time. The area was once a town in late 1800s which is evidenced by the grist mill remains on display. I hiked the River Trail along the Santa Fe River. Many types of trees and plants are found along the trail. Natural levees are prominent along the shore of the river. I was stunned to discover that the river flows into a giant sinkhole and emerges 3 miles away. It was an impressive sight! While the trail was nice, there were a large number of bugs. I applied bug spray ahead of time so it wasn‚Äôt a big issue for me. I did see a tortoise and some turtles along the road into park and the trail. This park is only 5 miles off I-75.

Wonderful park for the day or overnight camping. There are many miles of hiking trails and lots of shade from the beautiful tall pine trees.

3/20/2019,"I stayed in one of the cabins earlier this week and sincerely wish I had not. I camp a lot all over the country and I was not expecting luxury accommodations. However, the filth level in this cabin was actually pretty alarming. When I entered, I touched my hand to the footboard of the double bed and it was extremely sticky. There was an apple slice on the floor with bugs on it. When my kids crossed the floor barefooted, which takes about three steps, they had truly blackened feet by the time they got to the bed. The ""white"" interior walls were visibly coated in dirt. I am a fan of hygiene, but when I went to the showers (to wash my feet so I could go to bed) I saw a pile of ants in the shower that looked like they were congregating on something sticky. It grossed me out bad enough that we skipped showers altogether during our visit. We did rent kayaks from the outfitter there. The staff was pretty bored and irritated when ai asked questions. The actual paddle was pleasant enough. I am a huge fan of Florida State Parks and I almost feel guilty writing this review, but with so many other awesome destinations in south Florida, I would advise travelers to just skip this destination.

They also have mountain bikes, cruiser bikes available for rent.On my second trip, I was lucky enough to see a Manatee, several bird species and several Iguana's.The staff at the Outdoor center were courteous and professional.

5/1/2019,"I assume this is a lesser visited Civil War Battlefield Park as we were the only ones there apart from the ranger. It least he was pleased to see us and gave us lots of info before leaving us to look around the small old visitor center. (The ranger gave us a ‚ÄòJunior Ranger‚Äô badge each, a fab souvenir-considering we‚Äôre over 50!)There a few displays and a longish film describing the battle here. The film has lots of footage of the annual February re-enactments. There are a few monuments and a cannon display out front of the VC. The easy walking trail begins at the large information boards and wends its way through what is now just a lot of trees with nothing much else than that to see. There are story boards at regular intervals that describe the day‚Äôs battle events chronologically more or less hour by hour.

I already knew some about the battle at Olustee, but I learned a ton more from the indoor exhibit and the 1-mile battlefield hike. The exhibits, while dated, were extremely informative. A new visitor center will be built soon modernizing the exhibit. The memorial commemorating the battle is very impressive. I walked the 1-mile battlefield trail which has plaques discussing the stages of the battle. The battlefield itself appears to be very well-preserved and closely matches the descriptions of the area in 1864.

We came to the Orman House on Sunday. Visited the surrounding grounds seeing the war memorial and gardens(still damaged from the hurricane). Then went into the house. The tours ($2/person) are on the hour and we came in between. The very friendly tour guide was waiting for other people who were due to come for the on the hour guided tour. He gave us the option to wait or do a self guided tour. Since we were on a schedule we took his offer to do the self guided tour. He gave us information about the house/owners (3 pages) and told us he would check on us throughout. As we went throughout the house we were fascinated by the historic contents (furniture, etc). My personal favorite was the bedroom that had several historic women's dresses, etc showing the different styles of long ago eras. I was able to take photos which other historic homes don't allow. That was a great treat for me because photos are the best souvenirs. True to his word the tour guide checked on us several times giving us bits of information, interesting facts. He looked like he has wealth of information and is a shame we were not able to experience his full tour. Looking forward for next time. I would recommend this historic  home- 2 thumbs up!!!

We did the first loop of the trail but the last part to the tower was closed. Nice scenery and a pleasant walk.We then carried on driving to the boardwalk which was really nice. The drive there with the water on both sides of the road was really scenic.We had then planned on driving to the north entrance to do some more walking but ended up stopping at Sweetwater wetlands park which was so good we spent hours there and unfortunately didn't have any more time to explore Paynes preserve.If you go on a good dry day when everything is open I suspect there's some great scenery to see, especially from the observation towers.",flashsam7267,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Knaresborough,England,United Kingdom,Paynes Prairie Preserve State Parktripadvisorreviews
1/9/2021,"I had wanted to visit this location for a while, so when my family was vacationing in Ocala, I recommended going. This is an amazing state park with breathtaking prairie views reminiscent  of the west. We saw white-tailed deer, wild horses, green & brown anole lizards, a ribbon snake, spiders, many species of plants and a variety of unusual and beautiful fungi and lichens. The indoor visitor center was nice and had informative displays.  The picnic area where we ate, overlooks a beautiful expansive lake. Unfortunately I did not get to see most of the park due to my other family members having little interest in hiking or nature, but I definitely plan on returning. My only complaint was that although masks were mandatory inside the visitor center, they were not required on any of the outdoor trails or other areas, so we had to constantly avoid maskless families and other groups of ignorant individuals, at one point having a large mask less family try and all squeeze past us with no social distancing while we were attempting to climb down the steps of the observation tower. This is a State Park, so I don't know why they were not being more strict on mask requirements. Regardless, I was not going to let these fools ruin my experience.",MrMiamiExplorer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Miami,Florida,United States,Paynes Prairie Preserve State Parktripadvisorreviews

9/15/2020,"We visited with the hope of seeing some bison which we did not see when we visited in 2009. We were fortunate to see about 8 of them from the observation tower at the back of the main section of the park. You are able to walk several paths on the prairie and during one hike we found some of the wild horses. We visited during tropical storm Sally and many of the paths were very wet and muddy and the mosquitoes were terrible on some of the shaded trails. Be sure to bring bug spray. For the open trails, water and a hat are needed. These trails are quite long if you choose to follow them to the end and back. After the main park we drove to the bluff entrance further up 441 then around to the north entrance. The Alachua sink at the north entrance was a nice hike, but part of the trail was closed due to high water levels.

2/25/2020,"Spent 2 nights camping in our RV- our site was paved and next to the restroom.  We utilized the fire pit and charcoal grill.  Very quiet with beautiful trees and shade covering almost all campsites.  So much privacy and space separating each campsite.  The cleanest restroom I have ever seen at a campsite with great showers/hot water.  The park ranger and camp host actually set up a table with free coffee and pastries Saturday morning at 9am to just talk about the park and give insight (it was 36 degrees)!  The playground was cute but old and located on a path near the lake.  The most important part: IT IS 2 MILES FROM THE CAMPSITE TO THE VISITOR CENTER WHERE THE OBSERVATION TOWER AND TRAILS ARE LOCATED.  If you decide to walk the road to the center, please be cautious of cars- they seem to be oblivious to speed limits as the road has many bends and blind spots.  We unhooked the RV and drove to the visitor center and found plenty of RV parking.  Once at the visitor center, binoculars are available to borrow as well as a small gift shop.  As of February 22, horses were seen but no bison.  Many trails were also closed due to high water which was a bit disappointing.  We attempted to leave the park looking for trails only accessed from another entrance to the park but found it closed as well.",Gretchen32937,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Satellite Beach,Florida,United States,Paynes Prairie Preserve State Parktripadvisorreviews

We decided to hike the Cones Dike trail and see if we could get a closer look, we lucked out and found the herd about a mile in. It really was amazing! The animals roam freely so we were careful not to get to close. We decided to head to the north end of the park and check out La Chua trail which was totally worth it.. we got to see a momma gator and her babies sunning right next to the boardwalk!

Swim in the springs, jump off the concrete platform, lay in the stream that flows out of the springs... What a great place to bring the kids and let them unwind and cool off on a warm day.",TryppAdams,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Minneapolis,Minnesota,United States,Ponce de Leon Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

The state park is basically just the spring and the outflow from it with a short nature trail, restrooms and picnic area.   The spring is awesome, clear pure water, great visibility with or without a mask.   The water is cold but steady year-round like it is at all the Florida springs.",D.

10/24/2020,"It's not a big park. In fact, the posted hike times seemed inflated by a factor of 4. But the park packs a lot in. The hikes go through swamp terrain with cypress and palmettos. The highlight of the park is the spring pool with its turquoise water. The water was cold relative to October's air but there were people in the pool. The park itself was pretty quiet. There was plenty of shade so we put out some chairs and read books. A few tips: 1) The trails caution about alligators and bears. We didn't see any but it pays to pay attention. 2) The mosquitoes are waiting for you along the trails. 3) We didn't see manatees but read that we might have been a little early.

Well I have found just the place here at the State park in Ponce De Leon. Now if you are headed to the Pan handle of Florida, this isn't out of the way. But heads up warning. The reason the water is clear as a swimming pool, it's underground feed, meaning it is slightly on the cool side.If you don't care to swim, the pond has a small stream that is about ankle to knee deep water, great for wading. Picnic tables, nice shady place. The kids love it, us old folks, well we just like to look and like I said a wading pool, doesn't get any better.Well work the visit.",hurstdj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Katy,Texas,United States,Ponce de Leon Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

There are bathrooms (2 stalls) and a changing area (handicap stall) that is large enough to fit a family.  The swim area is handicap accessible with a ramp leading to the water. Tips: though the parking spaces are generous in size a larger RV would not fit in the parking lot during busy season.

6/22/2019,"We visited here yesterday, the heat index was 110 degrees outside yet jumping in this water will still take your breath away for a few seconds. The water was around 67 degrees. Crystal clear, very cool, sandy bottom. There are some tree roots in the water that you will stub your toes on if your not careful. Most of the main swimming area is fairly deep. Im 6'5 and could not touch in some areas so if you have very small children try the shallow parts of the creek on each side of the boardwalk its ankle to knee deep. There is an area that kids could jump into the water from a concrete type diving board, dont know how deep that area is as I was freezeing in the water and didnt stay long. We did take a walk down one of the paths, towards the fishing areas and there are signs to watch for gators, we didnt see any but we did see a snake. Since this was our first time visiting we do plan to make another trip shortly. There are grills and picnic tables. Pets are allowed but not in the swimming area.

After about 1/2 hour wait in car, we got to entry booth, paid $22.00 per person entry/park fee, filled out waiver and went to where tram picks you up & brings you about 5-6 miles upriver. Requires little to no experience. You float down-river for approximately 1 3/4 hours. If hot as it is now (Labor Day Weekend), water is in mid-70‚Äôs and is crystal clear... very refreshing!!!

Very relaxing, easy ""lazy river"" ride. The second day, we went to the main entrance, which, because of the pandemic, they only let in a  limited number of cars. We waited in line an hour before the gates opened at 8 a.m. Within 10 minutes, no cars could get in. Also, bring exact change ($2 per person!) or a credit card to get in. Well worth it! We kayaked and swam the crystal clear Rainbow River. On our way, we saw otters, birds and turtles.

7/11/2020,"My husband and I decided to take a trip here after hearing from friends how amazing the river is. We drove three hours to get to Rainbow River State Park and was so excited. I felt devastated when we arrived and found they were limiting capacity due to Covid-19 restrictions, which is understandable, it just wasn't posted on any of the websites. We did a quick loop down the long road past the park and when we got back around, I was amazed that we happened to be pulling up as another car was pulling out. They were doing one in, one out, so we barely made it in. We arrived around noon. I recommend getting there earlier!  It's $20 for the tube and experience which was well worth the price! We waited for a tram that took us up river. The wait was about 15 minutes. The ride was enjoyable! I left another review on the actual river and how amazing the experience of being on the Rainbow River was. This is for the actual park and our experience there. In short the river is crystal clear and you can see 30 feet down at some points. Everyone must experience it. I recommend packing light! We brought water bottles, shoes, glasses, snorkeling gear, sunblock- oh my gosh, just way too much junk! As if we were going to be putting more sunblock on as we floated down the river anyways. Bring NOTHING other than your bathing suit. I would leave your shoes in your car.When we exited the river at the end of our 2 hour journey, there was a really bad current while trying to exit! Be aware. The walk back to the car was beautiful and actually very relaxing. We definitely will go again. For anything other than tubing, we didn't explore at all so I'm not sure about any other amenities in this park.",Valerie G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,North Port,Florida,United States,Rainbow Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

Spanish moss hanging from the trees, azalea bushes blooming, trails, ‚Äòwaterfalls‚Äô, etc. Such a nice easy stroll and then you can end up at the water/swimming area. They have a portion of the headwaters of the spring roped off where you can swim. The area is fairly deep so you cannot stand and if you have small children, they will need to have some floatation device. There is not a real place to lie out like at the beach but you can picnic at a few tables. Further down from the swimming location you will find a place to rent kayaks.  Personally if I went to a spring to go swim, it would not be this one. I prefer like Alexander Springs or Kelly Park where there is a beach area as well. I find these two areas more kid friendly too.

9/22/2019,"At my wifes suggestion, we visited Rainbow Springs State Park.  I was surprised that it was only $2.00 per person (Adult) admission fee.  We wish ish many other State Parks were like this.  The park offers many trails that are concrete and lead to the Springs , Waterfalls, Butterfly Garden, and former Zoo attraction.  There is also a small Snack Shop offering Hot Dogs, Burgers and refreshments with covered out door seating, and a Gift Shop.  The park is mostly covered with many trees that must be extremely old, tall and offer shade keeping you cool while walking.  One can Swim in a roped off area, Kayak, Paddle Board, Picnic or Canoe on the Rainbow River that is crystal clear and 72 degrees year round.  There is plenty of parking available but watch for some of the potholes in the roadway.  We strolled along the trails taking in the waterfalls, the Flora, and seeing some Fish and Frogs along with many Birds.  They Falls are small but offer a tranquil place to just listen to the running water and enjoy the view.  Some paths lead to higher viewing areas.

We went in August which is off-season and it was still crowded in the ""pool"".  We were hoping to snorkel and see fish and turtles, but with all those people in there, there weren't any wildlife to be seen.

7/1/2019,"For those following my post about tubing springs. Here is the comparison for KP Hole & Rainbow River state park. 2 complete separate tubing places on Rainbow River.We went to KP hole. KP hole (which is the county park) tubbing was (It was 4 hours long) excellent. Nice and wide open. The water was so deep you never touch grass (unless you go to where you see it's high on purpose). You can bring a cooler while floating if you bring your own float. You can bring food & drinks in with reusable containers (no ziploc bags or plastic bags) we used Tupperware & yeti cups. No alcoholic drinks they search you coolers & your drinks. Saw some fish & birds & turtles. Little man loved it and he's 9. They did not require lifejackets & they give you a discount if you bring your own tubes (they have an air station for you to fill up your tubes). Bathrooms are clean with separate changing areas. Very nice facility.Went to Rainbow Springs State Park after. We were not impressed with the springs. Where they let you swim is super deep probably 8ft maybe deeper. Too deep for kids without lifejackets (the only shallow part they had was maybe 5x5 area for little babies & kids if no one else is there it might be good but it was to small of an area for even 10 people) & they don't share that information at the gate. The only floaty you can bring is a noodle. I wouldn't go back to the springs for swimming. When its busy because so many people are hanging onto the sides & sitting on the dock you can't really jump from it. Bathrooms were ok but no separate changing areas. If you choose tubing with Rainbow Springs state park it's a 2 hour tube ride. You must have a lifejacket, they do not give you a discount for bringing your own raft and from my understanding they only allow yeti cups for tubing -no cooler.",Kelly D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,St. Augustine Beach,Florida,United States,Rainbow Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews
6/30/2019,"The Rainbow Springs State Park is a place to visit if you want to experience old/real/ Natural Florida with beautiful flora and fauna.  This park has lots of amenities. Canoes and kayaks are available to rent;  also, there are walking the trails.  You can enjoy a 2-hour float down the Rainbow River. The river is created by natural spring bubbles up fresh spring water from the marvelous earth. The water is a beautiful greenish blue, and there is a section where you can swim.  The water temperature is 72 degrees water all year round.  Jumping right in is the easiest way to get in. If you put your foot in to try it out, you may not get it in because it will feel icy cold. But once you are in the water, your body gets acclimated to the coolness. On a hot summer day, it can cool you off, and on a cold winters day, it can warm you up.",1BeachAficionado,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Orlando,Florida,United States,Rainbow Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

You can bring food and also grill out while in the park. Several pavilions are available, but you need to arrive early to stake a claim. There is a kayak, canoe, and paddle board rental area  which is reasonably priced and you can rent either hourly or all day. We did an hour and were pretty tired by the time we returned. You can also jump out in the river while cruising around. Restrooms are clean and located in several places. You can also follow a small trail to a waterfall area which is a nice walk around the springs. There is a small entrance fee of $2.00 per person and parking is free.

We used our own tubes with head rests which were awesome after floating for an hour.  It made it a relaxing experience.

5/16/2019,"We visited five different springs over a long weekend. Rainbow Springs had the clearest water of the springs we visited (Poe, Blue Hole at Ichetucknee, Manatee, Three Sisters). It was georgeous. The entry to this park to visit the headsprings is only two dollars. There are paved paths to the headspings and the public facilities are nice. We would recommend visiting the park's website to plan your visit. There are three entrances to this park, one for the headsprings area, one for camping and one for tubing. The swimming area at the headsprings is large and deep, great for swimming and snorkeling. Flotation devices are not allowed (except for life jackets and noodles).The paddle launch at the headsprings area is quite a distance from the parking lot and would be a haul. If considering paddling from this area one would want to look into renting from the launch area unless your board or kayak is very light. From the launch one can paddle in the river but the headsprings area is roped off for swimming.If you are interested in more information about Rainbow Springs and other area springs visit our blog site in our profile.

You park where you will finish your tubing experience. The cost is $20pp plus $2pp park entry fee. They take all forms of payment. The tube & tram ride up the river is included. Everything is clean & in working order. There are bathrooms, & changing rooms there so you can change into dry clothes after your trip. This tube trip lasts about 2 hours.

That is better suited for those that want to stay on a flat easy path.  However my group chose the Azalea Trail which was 2.5 miles long.  And it went up and down and had lots of roots to navigate and a couple of Suspension Bridges which were really cool!  We definitely got a work out!

He is very knowledgeable.The drive around the Park is closed because of hurricane damage.

4/21/2019,"We visited Ravine Gardens today. The man at the gate was incredibly kind and very informative. He took the time to describe the overall layout of the park and gave us tips for getting the most out of our visit. I don't know his name, but whoever was working the entrance on Easter Sunday, please let him know his friendly welcome did not go unnoticed! I was a bit worried that it being a holiday, the indoor facilities might be closed. But the center was open and had a church service in progress in one of the rooms. Restrooms were very clean. We set out for the Azalea Trail first because the kids were excited about the suspension bridges. There's so much downhill and uphill walking that you almost forget you're in FL. The lower trail is marked strenuous. That's a pretty subjective term. I'm only moderately active and found the hike very manageable. There were only two spots that I found a bit challenging. The upper loop would be fine even for people with mobility issues, I would think. Lots of parents with strollers up there. The azalea bloom was already over in April, but there were beautiful wildflowers in the amphitheater. And the formal garden when you first enter the park is lovely.

They are easy to hike for the most part. There are places that are quite uneven and there are several places where there are steep drops if you stumble.

Yes, we saw some azaleas blooming and yes they were pretty, but not enough to make it worth while. At this point there needs to be so much work done to bring it up to a state park standard that I think this park will continue to decline. We saw no indication of recent hurricane damage and yet the rim road claims to be closed due to damage from the hurricane that was long ago.

2/17/2020,"I have visited there twice in the past month.  This park is beautiful, but go only during the middle of February when the azaleas are in bloom.My most recent visit was on a Saturday morning, but the park was not very crowded. The entrance fee is $5 per car and you can stay all day if you choose.  When you enter the park there are a few picnic tables and there are facilities in the main building.  There is a paved road that circles and leads down into the ravine, and a few paths that also down into the ravine.  These paths can be tricky since there are only a few paved steps that are steep without handrails.  Eventually the path becomes dirt and they can be full of roots.This time I followed the dirt paths into the ravine, and spent more time walking through the ravine. I was so glad.  I saw ""Old Florida"" -beautiful cypress trees in a wetland area.

3/23/2019,"Ravine Gardens State Park was a fun little find for our family. February is a good time to visit as the weather is just right and the azaleas were starting to bloom. I brought bug spray but we didn‚Äôt need it. The 1.8 mile Paved Loop is bike, jogger and stroller friendly whereas the 2.5 mile Azalea Trail has steep, historic and sometimes uneven stairs, as well as tons of tree roots. The best part is that it takes you through the two suspension bridges. We opted for the Azalea Trail but if you find yourself in need of a break, there‚Äôs ‚Äúexits‚Äù along the Azalea Trail where you can take a very short walk up to ‚Äúescape‚Äù up to the Paved Loop (just look for the green icons on the map). Just as the name states, the Azalea Trail is sprinkled with pink and color blossoms along the way. The Azalea loop was fine for our dog. In fact, we saw tons of dogs during our visit.[ Restrooms ]  - 2 sets - located near the parking lot inside the civic center & another set of restrooms is a very short walk from the amphitheater which is along the Paved Loop. [ PICNIC AREAS ] Pack snacks and water! Picnic tables can be found outside near the parking lot, near the amphitheater as well as near the small playground along the Paved Loop. We had a picnic lunch before starting our hike. The ‚Äúground level‚Äù  near the reflecting pond has a couple benches and a picnic table but there‚Äôs also a warning sign for alligators so you‚Äôve been warned! [ FEES / MAPS  ] The entrance is $5 per car (2-8 ppl max) or you can park outside the entrance and pay an ad hoc fee of something like $2 person/bicyclist. Single occupant cars are $4. I expected an honor system cash box but there was an attendant taking the cash and he had no way of making change so ** bring exact change ** , folks! He also ran out of printed maps but fortunately gave us the map to snap a picture of with our phones. Overall, I would highly recommend RG. I can‚Äôt wait to go back.

6/5/2019,"Yes, we haven‚Äôt been to the beach in 4 years. Mostly because the last several times we have went we had small children. Now that they are a little older, and can help carry stuff, it has been a great time indeed! Beach is littered with shells! But, not so bad you need shoes. Sugar white sand necessitates shades, a good hat, and plenty sunscreen. Bring a net and a bucket. If you choose to stop at one of the roadside pull offs there are far less people than going further down where they have the bathrooms and showers, although it still was not crowded at all! Each pull off has maybe 4-8 spots so come early. If you have a lot of stuff to carry, invest in a beach wagon or sleigh. Use baby powder to get the sand off at the car. No alcohol at the beach.

6/21/2019,"We came in our RV for 4 nights in June 2019. SGI State Park is beautiful and uncrowded. Stock up on everything before you drive in because the closest store is no less than 8 miles back into the little town from the campground. We like the Piggly Wiggly Express - they had a great meat counter and a pretty decent selection of food. To spend the day at the beach, you have two huge pavilions that have big parking lots and bathrooms, or you can go to one of the several ""pull-ins"" to be more secluded. This was our first trip to SGI, and knowing that it was recently devastated by Hurricane Michael, we read many comments that people said ""it wasn't the same place"" but honestly, it looked pretty great to us. It seemed like most of the facilities were open, some of the covered pavilions were closed off but everyone sits out closer to the water anyways. The beach was in pristine shape.The bathhouses in the campground are nice and clean - since this park doesn't have full hookups, we utilized those so we wouldn't have to go to the dump station mid-trip.Only one issue with the campground that we had was the mosquitos and biting flies will carry you away. They try to combat it - we were grilling out dinner and saw a spray truck come through the campground at dusk one night, but it didn't seem to phase the mosquitos. It was one of the worst mosquito and bug environments we've ever been in and we've been a lot of places. Bug sprays didn't work, we ended up just having to eat our meals inside the trailer, which was a bummer. It might be a good idea to get a bug net tent that goes over your picnic table but even then, I'm not sure how much that will keep out.",BSS970,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Tulsa,Oklahoma,United States,Saint George Island State Parktripadvisorreviews

I wish we‚Äôd spent more time on the beach but given its not dog-friendly we stayed on the private beach at the townhome just a quarter mile away. The park closes at sunset which means the beach does too even if you walk-on which I don‚Äôt understand because it boasts pretty night skies.

5/2/2019,"This park is part of a freshwater marsh or savana that used to cover the southeast coast of Florida. This preserve is one of the longest remaining tracts of east coast savanna. It is 10 miles long stretching from Ft. Pierce to Jensen Beach.The term savanna for the marshland and ponds was first used by Lt. Colonel Benjamin Pierce during the Second Seminole Wars. In 1879 Captain Thomas Richards came here from Key West to plant pineapples which thrived in the sandy soil. From 1895 to 1920 Jensen Beach became the pineapple capital of the world. In 1977, 6,000 acres of land were acquired to create a park that protects this biologically unique ecosystem. Today the park offers many amenities to the nature enthusiast. There are 15 miles of trails for hikers, bikers, and equestrians. There is also a canoe and kayak launch. At 8:30 AM every Friday and Saturday morning volunteers lead two hour guided tours. Reservations are required and you can call this number: 772-398-2779. Fishing is available in the park if you have the proper license. If all of the fun outdoor sports makes you hungry there are a number of picnic shelters around the preserve. To learn more about the savannas you can go to the Visitor Center Education Center which is open Thursday through Monday from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. I only got a chance to scratch the surface of this wonderful park and now I can't wait to come and explore it more fully. Admission to the park is $3 that you put into an envelope on the honor system. If you visit bring cash make sure to have the exact amount.

7/11/2019,"This Florida state park is over 1,000 acres along the Intracoastal Waterway south of Stuart. It has four miles of hiking trails over several different natural communities including sand pine scrub, scrubby flat woods,a baygall and a mangrove swamp. The baygall community is one of the rarest in Florida. It is a swampy habitat containing loblolly bay and sweetbay which act as filters for the run off water from the scrubby flatwoods. This helps to keep clean the water flowing into the Indian River Lagoon. The north trail loop is 3.2 miles of sand trail that winds like a maze through the scrub. The south loop is 1.9 miles and parallels the intracoastal but you can't see it. Bikers can ride on the East Coast Greenway, a paved path running from the parking lot into Hobe Sound. The preserve offers protection to the threatened Florida Scrub Jays and gopher tortoises. There is a restroom and benches adjacent to the parking lot but there  is absolutely no shade for the trails. In 90 degree weather it was brutal. I walked a small portion of the north trail but it was difficult because it's soft sand. There was a evidence of a recent fire.

The nearest town is Vero Beach, six miles south from the inlet.  The State Park is a good twenty miles from I-95. Free beaches can be had both north and south of the inlet.  The area has become a mecca for international surfing. There are plenty of fishing areas at the State Park.  Along the jetty and under the bridge are popular areas.  Boating is a popular past-time activity.  There is a boat ramps on the south-side in the State Park.  Frolicking in the Indian River sand bars is a major activity. There is a nice beach just north of the jetty in the State Park.  The Surfside Grill is located by the beach and jetty.  It is the only official concessionaire in the area.

8/14/2019,"Went every day we were on vacation. The cost was $8 to park but the park is open 24hrs which was superb! Plenty of places to fish from- piers, jetty, shoreline, beach- there was an RV and camping area, there was a boat launch. The bathrooms was amazingly clean and well stocked. We saw dozens of manatees, an underworld flock of rays, a giant manta ray jumped out of water four foot- simply beautiful; there was an unbelievable amount of birds including storks, cranes, biterins, terns, kites, and then some rabbits. Sunrise and sunset over looking the water was breath taking and right down the street was the largest Historic bird sanctuary in the US. A perfect place for families or seniors! As for fishing- which was why we came originally, we caught five kinds of snappers, puffer fish, grinds, fluke, barracuda, shark, and a million types of bait. A must for fisherman.",mked56,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wellington,Florida,United States,Sebastian Inlet State Parktripadvisorreviews

8/11/2019,"The website for the Sebastian Inlet State Park states:  ""A multi-use, paved path runs through the park parallel to state road A1A and, in sections, parallel to the Indian River Lagoon. Bicyclists will enjoy this forty-mile-long path with numerous beach access points"".  After a morning spent in frustration, looking for the ""40 miles"" of paths, what we found were 2 out of 3 poorly marked bike trails, one impassable due to dropped branches and a heavy load of sand, and one grassy 3 mile trail off the marina through the mangroves.  Neither of these were manageable with our average street-coasting bikes....though for mountain bikes.....perhaps.  And that promised ""multi-use paved path running parallel through the Park???""  We figured out this is the SIDEWALK that runs about 10 feet off the A1A Highway, right next to motorcycles, campers, SUVs and trailers racing down A1A to their own piece of vacation heaven.

6/27/2019,"We were booked into the Inlet for 4 nights and had to leave after 2 nights because the amperage of the electrical system was not enough to carry our air and refrigerator.  The frig basically went down as that side of the electrical just did not provide near the amps needed.  The neighbor across the road went to the ranger  office and they said they would send some one to check his. When he asked about checking mine site they told him no because I had not complained although he told them mine was down also.  So when the ranger came and checked his outlet the outlet actually had melted on one side.  I then asked if they could check mine and they did a reading that showed something at 109 and I was told that was as good as it could be.  I asked what the 109 meant and was told I had 30 amps.  After thinking about it all they did was a voltage reading that showed I was getting 109 volts.  This does not reflect the amps that were available.  We packed up and left as it was more than clear they could not do anything.  At home connected to a true 30 amp RV outlet my system, thankfully worked properly.  Both the air and frig were under extreme stress while at  the park and I almost lost my frig due to the system not operating near 30 amps.  THUS CAMPERS BE WARE.  YOU COULD DAMAGE YOUR UNITS ELECTRICAL SYSTEM  STAYING HERE.  The rangers are blaming FPL however the sites with the new electrical posts did not seem to have problems thus leading me to believe the park just needs to spend the money and replace the entire electric system.",cruzplanner,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sebastian,Florida,United States,Sebastian Inlet State Parktripadvisorreviews

The river flows out to the Ocean, and there are lots of walking paths, fishing opportunities along the river or under the bridge.  Clean restrooms are offered on each side.   I saw vending machines with $1.00 waters for 16.9 oz.   What a deal.   Camping is on one side with a grill/restaurant and changing rooms on the other side.  We spent most of our time under the bridge, but many were on the ocean beach and surfing was in order the day we were there.   There is a nice pier you can walk/fish on.   Super windy the day we were there.   Sometimes this place fills up.  No parking spots and you can't get in.  Many picnic tables for a nice lunch.  We really enjoy watching the pelicans dive for food.   The day we were there, there were two frigat birds and you won't forget them with their 7 foot wing span.  Just a great place to spend the day, for families, couples and singles.  TIP:  This is located 10-15 miles from any grocery stores so bring what you want along. Don't forget your hats and cameras.

12/8/2019,"We recently visited Sebastian Inlet State Park near Sebastian, Florida.  The entrance fee was $8 per carload. There were 3 adults and 2 children in our party, and we left reluctantly, wanting to come back soon.The highlights of our visit were observing the fishermen on the long, long jetty and then visiting the Sebastian Fishing museum in the park.  I learned that the Spanish Mackerel were running and so lots of fishermen were trying their luck.  Spanish mackerel are a fast swimming fish that are prevalent throughout Florida's coastal waters when water temperatures exceed 70 degrees. To remain in warm water, Spanish mackerel migrate out of the northern parts of the state in the fall of the year and return to the north in April with the warming waters.  So, the fish were zooming along, getting carried quickly into the inlet and past hopeful fishermen.  I was surprised by the rushing speed of the water leaving the ocean and rushing through the inlet.  It looked a lot like the rushing waters of a mountain river it was so fast.  I found the variety and innovation of the fishing setups interesting.  One ardent fisherman had a small generator which was running an aerator which was keeping the bait fish in a plastic tub well-oxygenated and lively.  Each fisherman seemed to have their own preferred bait -- some liking various small fish, and some using brown shrimp.  It was fun to see some successful catches, not just of mackerel but also a huge 'dog-mouthed' snapper.After watching the fishing action for awhile, we walked the jetty back to our car and drove over the 'rainbow' shaped bridge to visit the Sebastian Fishing Museum on the other bank of the inlet.  Admission to the museum is free with your $8/carload fee to enter the state park.  The museum is small and well-focused.  I enjoyed learning about the thriving fishing industry which sprang up after the pineapple industry was wiped out.  The children enjoyed looking at the various exhibits such as all the menacing hooks used to catch the fish.  We ended our visit by enjoying the benches and park-like grassy area along the inlet bank in front of the museum.We decided we needed to come back to this state park on another visit to check out the tide pools and sandy beach area on the north side of the inlet and to try our hand at finding seashells along the beach north of the jetty.  We saw generous amounts of shells thrown ashore there.",Valerie S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Los Alamos,New Mexico,United States,Sebastian Inlet State Parktripadvisorreviews

The pier is as it's always been, full of people, most of them fishing, a few looking at the gorgeous clear waters & seeing the sea life. You never know what you'll see. The inlet area was revamped over the years for a more protected place for kids & swimmers who might not want to go out into the ocean. All of it Is Really a Fantastic View. So much to Take In & Well Worth the Visit! As for the fishing, We've caught years ago, Flounder & Snapper. We've seen on the beach side area of the pier looking out, Dolphins, Manatees, Birds of All Kinds, Turtles, Rays & schools of Fish, some being chased, then you look at sure enough, likely to be a Barracuda. Seen a few. Saw one couple of weeks ago. It's a Very Interesting place with So Much to Do, See, even their snack place or Shop or Camping or that swimming area in the actual Inlet area.

7/24/2019,"Every time my wife and I drive over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge that spans Tampa Bay between St. Petersburg and Bradenton on Florida's West Coast, we notice the pilings of the longest fishing pier in the world and recall they are the remnants of the original bridge that partially collapsed in 1980 after an ocean-going freighter collided with one of the pilings in a storm, killing many people. Today, those pilings are part of Skyway Fishing Pier State Park, which was established in 1994. Even today, it gives us an unsettling feeling. We still recall seeing the old bridge before it was demolished to make way for the current Sunshine Skyway. The most common activity on the pier is fishing. For a fee, anglers can able to fish for grouper, snook, tarpon, black sea bass, Spanish mackerel, cobia, king mackerel, sheepshead, red snapper and flounder for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

There are two fishing piers on each side of the bridge.We stopped at the southern one in Mantee County rest area. This pier is longer and takes you closer to the central pylons.

1/25/2021,"As usual, this is without comparison the most gorgeous beach I've ever seen!   There may be better in some place where I've never been, but this is the kind of beach that lovers of wide, wild, clean, unpopulated, uncivilized beaches dream about.  There's not a man-made structure in sight, plenty of indigenous shells, birds, dunes, crabs...  $6 per car is an exceptional bargain and they need the $ to rebuild.  Visitors should know that the park was literally destroyed in 2018 by hurricane Michael, which cut a channel through the peninsula and made most of the park inaccessible.  We have been anxious to see what hurricane Michael did to our favorite and often-visited camping park.  The parking by the boat launch is the extent of the available road but the ranger at the entrance building confirmed the information on the park website, that the cut has naturally filled back in, they are hoping to put the road back in soon, and they hope to have camping available for 2022.  Where Gulf Breeze sites were, they are planning a day-use-only area, and what was Shady Pines will be a double-loop camping area.  She did not mention the cabins and since I've never been able to reserve one, I forgot to ask about those.  It is not possible to access any part of the interior past the boat launch parking area.  The restrooms are still closed, and there are porta-potties (with REALLY HIGH seats.  For ladies who do not want to touch anything, especially the seat, this is a real challenge!)  Along the dune line for about 2 miles (?) down the beach, there is a rope and signs to stay out of the interior.  As long as you look the other way, you can maintain that ""untouched nature preserve"" feeling.  We were extremely disappointed that we could not see the area where the cut happened from any angle.  Chain-link construction fences surround the area.  We walked a few miles down the beach toward the tip and were happy to see that not all of the dunes are gone, or that Mother Nature has somewhat rebuilt them.  A lot of great effort has been made to replant sea oats along the dunes.  Except for a single piece of wood piling, there was no sign of any of the former boardwalks and steps.  Michael took them away.  Even from the beach, we could see that Shady Pines should probably have a new name going forward.   It is now as exposed as Gulf Breeze was, and it will be a LONG TIME before young trees grow up enough to re-create the shade.  To those who will tent-camp here during hot weather in the coming decade, bring a shade tarp to put over your tent!  I love knowing that the restrooms will be brand-new.   I hope they will maintain the vegetative spaces between sites!!  Aside from the beach-side location, the privacy was the primary appeal of camping here.",Tiffany A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Opp,Alabama,United States,St Joseph Peninsula State Parktripadvisorreviews

6/29/2020,"This park is beautiful, but I think my expectations were too high.  There was only one parking lot open and once that is filled, no one else can enter the park.  I envisioned being able to get away from the crowds and park far into the park, but that is not at all the situation.  The parking lot is just past the entrance and then the road ends.Once parked, you can choose to walk to the bay or gulf side.  We started on the bay side because we had heard it was great for snorkeling.  Unfortunately, the water was very cloudy and we could not see much at all besides a ton of sea urchins and some hermit crabs.  Definitely wear water shoes!  After an hour or so of trying to snorkel, we walked the short trail to the gulf side.  The beach is absolutely gorgeous.  White sand, room to spread out.  There was a yellow flag, but the waves were very manageable and the kids had fun.  My only concern was that there were so many jellyfish!  We live in Florida and this is by far the most I have ever seen on a beach.  I was a nervous wreck the whole time the kids were playing!  Hopefully this was just a strange day... it is such a beautiful beach and I would love to come back someday once they finish all the repairs and the entire park is opened up.",FloridaRebel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Bartow,Florida,United States,St Joseph Peninsula State Parktripadvisorreviews

10/14/2019,"If you are familiar with St. Joseph Peninsula State Park you know it is beautiful and very raw.   There isn't much here except what you bring.    The satellite images don't lie, Michael cut the peninsula in half creating an island just past the marina.   The huge dunes in that section are gone, but mother nature has actually patched that section and it is no longer an island on the northern tip of the state park.    There are huge sections of asphalt (road) in the bay so if you go snorkeling you will likely see some road gators out there :)Wildlife seems to be recovering nicely, but if you use to camp in the state park with an RV, that road is completely gone.   You can't get much past the Marina.   Scallop Cove Too is still operating and have pontoons you can rent bay side.      If you are new to the state park I highly suggest going in.   It's a great place to park, rent a kayak and snorkel to see all the wildlife the bay has to offer (sharks, large shells, dolphins, rays, horseshoe crabs, and all sorts of fish.)    Take a cooler and a picnic and make a day of it.

1/6/2020,"We camped here three years ago (2 yrs before Hurricane Michael) and fell in love with the natural beauty and fantastic beaches. Michael may have wiped out the campgrounds, but the beaches are still soft and white and there is still the option of bay-side with no surf which is great for snorkeling and kayaking and gulf-side with surf and wide beaches. Even without the campgounds (which will be rebuilt we were told) it is definitely worth a day trip. The day-use fee is minimal and keeps the crowds away.

It is a nice 3 mile hike from the parking lot to the pass and back, through mostly shade, or a choice of sun on the bay side or on the gulf side. Once at the tip of the key, you'll find ominous tall dead tree trunks piercing the sky, engraved and surrounded with cool artwork. Afterwards, stop by one of them many bars that dot the beachside to quench your thirst. ",DaisyBB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sarasota,Florida,United States,Stump Pass Beach State Parktripadvisorreviews

SWIMMING: A lot of the beach is good for kids with fairly shallow drop offs, no rocks. Some small sandy tide pools. No swimming at the point due to heavy currents. SHELLING: Yes. Not necessarily rare pieces or the variety you‚Äôll find at Sanibel but still quite a few. Apparently a few sharks teeth also but I didn‚Äôt look. FISHING: there were some fisherman there but it‚Äôs not the main activity. CAUTION: You won‚Äôt need shoes on the beach.

As I was parking the car I thought I must have hit a bugs nest, the car was being attacked by small red flying bugs. After applying bug repellent, we exited the car only to be immediately attacked by these same biting bugs. My wife turned back after only 100 yards on the trail, I continued on, thinking it would get better. I was wrong, the onslaught continued.

The park is on the site of an old city called Columbus that was active until about 100 years ago. All the remains is the cemetery and the stagecoach road. Confederate Earthworks underscore the importance of the area‚Äôs bridges. The views of the Suwannee and Withlachoochee Rivers were stunning along the trails and platforms. There are other spring runs and bridges scattered about. It was so beautiful, remote, and relaxing. We hiked all the 5 miles of trails on the south side of the Suwannee in about 2 hours.

So I'll break down a few aspects.Location:  right on the Suwannee River in a deciduous forestLodging:  there's a nice campground but also cabinsHistorical significance:  on the site of the extant town of Columbus whose cemetary is still there on one of the trails, the location of Civil War earthworks which are still there, the location of the first bridge across the Suwannee River - only a bit of the columns are still thereFavorite things about this park:  It has a good boat ramp and is a perfect spot for taking out kayaks coming from upriver.  There are a few small springs that you can hike to on the trails, but one located right next to the river which can always be found bubbling!, The bridge over Lime Sink Run and nearby is a cool spot to explore with kids.  The Withlacoochee River meets the Suwannee right across from the picnic area and for the adventurous, take the trail that crosses the river and check out the remains of the location of the spring that ran the old saw mill.",SuwanneeSong,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Live Oak,Florida,United States,Suwannee River State Parktripadvisorreviews

The scenery is spectacular, with magnificent live oak trees shading the trail and small farms along the way. The condition of the trail is excellent, straight, very well maintained, no debris, no bumps from tree roots. There is the added bonus of several concrete building rest rooms with benches. AND...get this...at each street crossing in which we encountered a vehicle, every single driver (total of 10) stopped to allow us to pass, waving us on. We have never encountered so many polite vehicle drivers while cycling. At the end of the trail there is a scenic park with picnic tables along the banks of the Wakulla River.

3/26/2020,"Terra Ceia Preserve is a state park; being a huge aquatic preserve, it faces Tampa Bay , Terra Ceia Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. After Sunshine Sky Bridge, you access it from US 41 and then to 130 Terra Ceia Road. Surrounded by an enormous water basin, this park has a particular vegetation. It is mainly dense, jungle-like mangroves, wetlands, mudflats, marshes, and the like - with some water ways, not too easily accessible, as we could see. The shoreline at the northern part of the preserve is ragged with stones. All this gives a very  untouched look to the whole scenery. We were in the park not for a long time - and not in on very good weather day - but we managed to see some wading birds that love this type of wild habitat.Speaking of wild: the park is not very customer-oriented, in a sense that there are no picnic areas or restrooms, there are some trails , but the grass around is uncut and very tall, so I 'm not sure I'd suggest this park for any family-and-friends picnic day. It's more for the wild nature admirers, it seems. Also for kayaking through mangroves.

The spaces were very close together, but the area looked clean & safe. The picnic area was large, with a pavillion under roof & several individual picnic tables scattered around. Lake Seminole Reservoir is the primary attraction, but I found it odd that each main area (boat ramp, day-use/picnic area, & campground) were pretty far apart from each other by car, but still on the water.

The park sits next to Lake Seminole with an easy access boat ramp.  Our site had a large concrete pad, picnic table, fire pit and charcoal barbeque.  Sites are equipped with electric and water but no sewer.  There is a centralized dump station as you exit the park.  You‚Äôll have to check in at the Ranger Station, this is not the registration office, that building is in the center of the RV park.  Check in was a breeze.  We did see the registration office was only open from 1600-1630 daily.  This isn‚Äôt a huge park; just 30-sites. Plenty of space to walk our dog and a number of nice walking trails that due to the rainy wx we couldn‚Äôt enjoy.

The campsites are very nice and we found the facilities to be adequate, though certainly not the best I've seen at a state park. Things within the park were not well marked so it was a little confusin as to what was where. The statue was undergoing repairs but it's still fairly impressive - if bizarre.

My daughter drove them over to the camp store and they hiked one of the trails, saw the statue, etc. The playground area didn‚Äôt offer much at all.My main concern was the restroom/shower facilities. They were clean and didn‚Äôt smell which was nice but at night the sidewalk area is in total darkness which makes it difficult to navigate to the bathroom.

7/25/2019,"If you want to camp or fish, this is a good place for you. We just wanted to see nature and go for a kayak trip on the river. Unfortunately when we entered the park on a Wednesday in July, there was a sign that the store was closed and there was no kayak or canoe rentals. We decided to pay our $5 to check out the park anyway. We came across a few fishermen and ladies and found the Tomoka statue and lots of mosquitos! We didn't stay very long at all. The drive into the park, past the houses on the river was pretty. If we could have gone kayaking it would have been more interesting. I'm guessing the afternoon's predicted showers influenced the decision to shut down the outpost and the kayak and canoe rentals. Too bad because the rains weren't as bad as predicted - very brief. Oh well.",DesPeresGirl,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Naples,Florida,United States,Tomoka State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/2/2019,Great park for deep woods camping close to town. We stayed just for the night while passing through and it was raining pretty hard so we couldn't explore the park like we wanted but it seemed like a very nice park especially for kayakers and fishermen. The park store was cool and well stocked with everything from normal needs to unique gifts. Only downfall was the roads. Dirt roads are no problem but the are in need of repair. Very deep potholes!!  ,garyleeb2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Lake City,Florida,United States,Tomoka State Parktripadvisorreviews

My street, Shockney Drive is a dead end street and does not have an entrance to the park, which is about 4 miles north of me.  Large RV's and other people headed to the park come down my street and have difficulty in trying to turn around to get out.  Several GPS systems send drivers this way, which is incorrect.

Scott, at the Tomoka Outpost, is a real gem and has built a nice relaxing space to hang out on the river.

2/11/2020,"We stayed here at the campground for 4 nights.  The only issue was our space was very difficult to back in to as there was a fence across the road and very little turning room.  We finally got in by going the opposite direction on the one way street but it was tight.  Other folks had similar issues so be sure to inquire about the specific space.  The park was nice, had good, clean bath houses with hot showers.  They have laundry but it was not working when we were there.  There are lots of roads to bike on, a great paved bike trail just across the street from the entrance and lots of hiking in the area.  We would ride to the store and have a glass of wine sitting on their dock overlooking the river.  You are right in Ormond Beach so you have many stores and restaurants as needed.

8/13/2020,"We found this place to be interesting. I liked that we could drive around most of the park, even though we did prefer to walk. We're hikers from Pennsylvania and discovered this state park while on vacation, we didn't exactly plan on hiking while in FL, but could resist the opportunity either, so we really weren't prepared with clothing/footwear and bug spray. We had a great experience until we attempted to hike the nature trail. We took just a few steps onto the trail and were swarmed by mosquitoes. We retreated. That was the only place we had an issue with mosquitoes, all other areas of the park were fine. We saw gator tracks, belly and tail drag marks but no actual gators. The park store was not open due to current COVID situations, so kayak and canoe rentals were off the table. But all in all, we went to spend the day with nature and that's what we did. We'd visit again... next time we'll bring bug spray!",Cassandra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Elysburg,Pennsylvania,United States,Tomoka State Parktripadvisorreviews
2/18/2020,We were doing a fast four night Fllorida getaway. We drove through Saint Augustine and connected on A1A headed south. It is a beautiful drive along the Atlantic ocean until we reach Tamoka State Park.  The drive from Flagler Beach to Tamoka is very beautiful and highly recommend as a way of coming into the state park. We were told if your having a bad day in Ormond Beach everyone tells you to do the loop. We highly recommend doing this just to get you relaxed before your camping adventure. The park rangers are very friendly and very accommodating. Campsites are well-maintained. Most campsites are full shade. I did not feel like I was living in my neighbors backyard. We received a good dose of nature.  There‚Äôs a short walk to the statue of the Indian chief Tomuka. There are longer nature trails but we did not take them.

12/11/2019,"All I can say is WOW! I had visited Torreya a few years back and when I came this weekend I was taken aback! It was barren!! The tress (or lack there of) were greatly affected by Hurricane Michael. The park's foliage is trying to make a comeback and the Park Services have planted saplings all over the park in efforts to bring back the beautiful foliage/tress that made Torreya SP what it is: The Torreya Tree. The Florida Torreya is one of the world's rarest trees!( from web site) ""Because the Torreya is one of America's most endangered trees, a major effort is underway to save it. The Florida Park Service is working with the Atlanta Botanical Garden in a commendable effort to grow new Torreya trees. Using seed obtained from living trees, the agencies are growing seedlings that are being planted in the ravine habitat at Torreya State Park. Perhaps over time, the Torreya will once again thrive along the Apalachicola."")Bathrooms were spotless! Glenda the hostess was very nice and courteous when I asked questions. Ice bags were a bit expen$ive ($4/bag), sites were nice and sized just right. had site #7 (cement pad) AWESOME!! Cell/phone reception was ok. TV reception was not so good! There is a tour of the historic Gregory House (at 2pm & 4pm on weekends) but we did not go. Instead, some of us hiked a somewhat semi open/closed hiking trail? Wildlife was visible all around us.MY ONLY NEGATIVE COMMENT (that is why I gave it 4 stars not 5) was that in the CABIN next to site #9, I was site #8, the occupants were obnoxiously loud most of the time with their kids. The kids themselves were not loud, but the ""MOM"" or adult lady was like screeching at the top of her lungs morning, noon and nite everytime she wanted to get the kids attentions! At night time and during morning ""quite hours"" all you heard was this lady yelling at the kids or husband, 'get in here now"", ""what did I tell you"", etc. etc. She had no inner voice!!Luckily for me the cabin folks left mid day on Sunday so I did have some quiet time till I checked out on Monday afternoon. Otherwise this was a wonderful time spent with family & friends.I will continue to do my part and support the Florida Paks system by camping as much as I can afford to.PS. there is also a type of camp club house/ registration office where you can gather and have a pot luck of sorts ( when I went to register some ladies were playing what seemed to be a mean game of Bunco!)",prrum007,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Tallahassee,Florida,United States,Torreya State Parktripadvisorreviews

10/9/2019,"Ordinarily, I'd give this park a top rating.  It has scenic vistas overlooking the Apalachicola River, high bluffs and deep ravines, probably the steepest hiking trails in Florida.  Unfortunately, most of the hiking trails, including all going to the river, are closed due to damage caused by Hurricane Michael in 2018. Some trails are still open; however, the hurricane damage is evident throughout the park.  Foliage on the trees is just returning.

It seems to be at a relatively high elevation for Florida; you can see how far the swamps and forests go, and it‚Äôs quite a way.

9/30/2019,"I grew up in this area and have visited the park in various stages of my life and its. My recollections from childhood visits were of a tale of a rich man who thought that the presence of the Torreya trees meant that it was the biblical Garden of Eden; the Torreya tree was said to be the wood used to build Noah‚Äôs ark. You will find no mention of that version of the park‚Äôs history as it was sanitized several decades ago. About 15 years ago I took my wife to the park and asked a ranger directly about what had once been the standard spiel. With extreme care in word choices the ranger explained that they were not familiar with that information. The Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, FL has similarly erased information regarding the imprisonment of the Seminole Indian Chief Osceola. In 1962/1963 I saw his cell but within ten to fifteen years it was inaccessible and its existence and his imprisonment were denied. Anyway, Torreya Park is lovely and has an interesting history that isn‚Äôt dependent on claims of being Eden. There are camp sites and picnic facilities and access fees are very reasonable. Great day trip although hiking trails are closed due to hurricane damage.",Warurmonk,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Ranchos de Taos,New Mexico,United States,Torreya State Parktripadvisorreviews
10/27/2020,"We stayed here 4 nights in our RV on our way to spend the winter in Pensacola..  The good - friendly rangers and hosts; quiet; water and electric hookups at all sites; dump station; washer and dryer (not listed on web site); hiking trails.  The not so good - our site and many others are very narrow and close together; our site was soft sand; campground road is hard packed sand while all other roads are paved; dump station hard to use a portable waste tank at due to high curb around dump pipe and soft sand in front of it; web site says ""canoe/kayak launch available"" but we found it is 9 miles from campground on a not safe or well maintained county dirt road and the river current is too swift to paddle up stream and back; 14 miles to nearest groceries and then it is overpriced Piggly Wiggly; quite a ways off I-10 to this park.  All things considered we would not stay here again. We have stayed at many Florida state park campgrounds and this one is the first we would not return to.  Seems to us this park would benefit from some upgrades like paving the campground road, making the dump station more user friendly to portable waste tanks (need to use if staying long enough for your grey water tank to get full), maybe eliminate some of the camp sites so more space between them, have a small store on site for basics like bread and milk, etc.  Lastly, we did visit one local attraction - Panhandle Pioneer Settlement in Blountstown - highly recommend - make sure you get a tour of all the buildings.",Jerry J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Hendersonville,North Carolina,United States,Torreya State Parktripadvisorreviews
7/13/2019,So to start off this park is beautiful great walking and water features. Honestly it would be a easy 5 stars except we arrived late after dark and there is a road leading into the campgrounds that allows water run off from the lake to cross the street and into a stream under normal circumstance I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with this except it was midnight there were no street lights and it was a steady flow so I had no idea it was designed like that I thought the road had flooded so I had to walk all the way across to make sure it was safe before driving on my wife and daughter were terrified even after I‚Äôd checked it out. I‚Äôd recommend some sort of street lighting or a sign to indicate it.

At the edge there is a huge lake and it is such a gorgeous view. They have a park for the kids, bathrooms, a gift shop, and a huge picnic area as well, so you really could spend almost an entire day here.

8/3/2019,"WOGSP is a treasure. On the Western side of A1A you'll find the Botanical Gardens where you discover exotic plants thriving among ancient oaks and The Intracoastal Waterway.But it is on the Eastern side of A1A or the beach side where you will see the rocks. But not just any rocks, here's an outcropping of Coquina which are millions of years old. Depending on the the time and tide you'll see the copper colored Anastasia Formation as it is known. Bring your cameras and be prepared to be dazzled especially at dawn as the sun lights these stones and their colors seem to pop.The tide pools can yield some trapped seashells and other small marine life which will delight any collector. Sturdy beach shoes will be needed as walking on the Coquina can be rough. A bit of Trivia - the Castillo de San Marcos was constructed using Coquina. So if your visit includes continuing North on A1A to St Augustine, you'll see the famous fort. This would make a terrific day trip.",bobbyd1959,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Palm Coast,Florida,United States,Washington Oaks Gardens State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/27/2019,"Visited Washington Oaks State Park in Palm Coast this past weekend.  The place was donated to the state buy its owners in 1964.  It is not very big and can be easily covered in about an hour or so.  The landscape is wonderful and the place is immaculately maintained.  There is a beautiful rose garden with a variety of roses, some with fragrance.  There is a pond in the center beautifully embellished with a variety of local plants.  They offer a picnic garden and nature trails.  The east side of the park overlooks Matanzas River.  Across the road on the opposite side is access to the beach.  My main purpose was to go for sunrise photography as I had heard about interesting rock formations in  the foreground.  Unfortunately they do not open until 8 AM.  They are however open until sunset.  There is a dollar five entry fee per vehicle.I was very impressed by the layout design and maintenance.  There is a lot of shade provided by several oak trees and as such can be explored during the day.  I would definitely visit the place again.  I would highly recommend it to any nature lover and photographer.  It offers photo opportunities especially at the Rose Garden and the adjacent beach.  I wish they would open at sunrise.",SunnyMD1963,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Ocala,Florida,United States,Washington Oaks Gardens State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/14/2019,"I spent Mother's Day at Washington Oaks with my boys (7, 12, 14). We enjoyed hiking the loop trail, then had a picnic under one of the magnificent oaks. The hike was largely shaded and featured quite a few different scenes: from the waterway, to a tree canopy,  to a more beachy/dunes area. The trails are well-marked and flat so anyone would enjoy them. The formal gardens are absolutely beautiful and made such a pretty backdrop for Mother's Day pictures. The rose garden was in full bloom, as were flower beds all over the park. There's enough shade to enjoy the gardens, even on a hot day. We went across the street to the beach and my boys loved the coquina rocks. Exploring and climbing on the rocks was the highlight of their day. Washington Oaks has been on my ""local bucket list"" for a while, and I am glad I made the effort to enjoy it.

There is a rose garden with the most stunning roses, and a butterfly garden. There is also a house down by the river that was built in the 1930‚Äôs by the Youngs that you can go inside and read about the history of the property.

8/29/2020,My husband and I visited in morning and had the whole park practically to ourselves. There were several volunteers working outside. We had previously visited the beach side with the majestic coquina rocks but this was a first to the park/garden side. We brought breakfast sandwiches and parked at the end of the park near the children‚Äôs playground where there is a shady picnic area. We picked up the nature hiking trail there and it was shady and lush green. Several signs along way point out specific plants and along the Matanzas there are some benches to sit a spell and watch birds. There are bait stations so I guess this is popular for fishing too. The formal gardens are absolutely stunning with a rise garden and many water features. There are signs explaining the historical background of the site. The gift shop and plant sales were not open due to COVID but I will definitely return.

If you love nature then you will love the beauty of this park.  It was quiet and serene.  The beachside is also so neat because of the rock formations.  It's a must-see in this area.

In the past the property was part of a plantation that used slavery when the Spanish owned Florida, but nothing remains from that time beyond documents.

Hwy A1A separates the the park, with the beach and ocean on one side and ancient oaks, gardens and trails on the other. Decided to check out the garden side first.  Roses and Azaleas were blooming and I saw an orange tree with loads of oranges on it, of course they were all too high to reach, lol.  The park backs up to a river and has an area where you can fish or just sit and relax.  The beach side was really nice and nearly deserted. Wonderful place to just come and relax.

The Matanzas River with people fishing, the ocean walk with the coquina rocks, the home, the variety of plants, the formal multi-colored rose garden, the stone and water features, and the helpful staff all helped to make this a perfect place to visit.We spent about two and a half hours here and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The mix of tropical plants was fun and several plants were in bloom. The shell ginger flowers were gorgeous. I also saw my first blooming travelers palm flowers. They looked like bird of paradise flowers until we realized they were part of the palm itself. We were able to see most of the roses flowering except the yellow. We enjoyed seeing the variety of colors and checking out which roses were the most scented. Each section of the gardens was lovely and the varying vistas created throughout the grounds made for fun photo opportunities. The workers and volunteers we encountered were knowledgeable and helpful, answering questions and identifying plants despite the vague descriptions we were giving them. Be sure to check out the two huge staghorn ferns hanging from trees. They‚Äôre impressive!I do recommend taking water, especially with the heat, and having bug spray available. We saw dozens of dead jellyfish on the beach so be mindful where you step. The entry cost was $5 per vehicle. Parking was plentiful at both the garden and beach sides of the highway. There were restrooms near the parking lot. The site has a Gift Shop but the open hours are limited.I plan to return frequently despite the drive...

9/25/2020,"Kayaking/Canoeing at Weeki Wachee State Park, Weeki Wachee RiverReview of Weeki Wachee SpringsReviewed 1 week agoNOTE: the 5 star rating is for the river/springs only. Concessionaire would be MUCH less.Fabulous cold springs and river on which I have kayaked for 20+ years (with own boats), since before the area was a State Park. The rental Concessionaire for the Park has changed several times, also pricing, offerings, trips, etc. - currently Weeki Fresh Water Adventures. BE SURE to call ahead for updates, as often not posted on website. Trip is now from State Park to Roger's Park, about 6 miles, but that is soon to change!The trip down the river to Roger's Park take-out takes anywhere from 2-4 hours, approx., depending on whether or not you take time to swim, lunch, rest, etc. This is slow moving water, not a difficult paddle, with beautiful flora and fauna. After your relaxing trip down the river, a visit to ""Marker 48 Brewing"" for a bite and brew is highly recommended!On Thurs., 10 Sept., '20 I learned that many of the rules had changed yet again, and will soon be changing AGAIN as of 01 Oct. '20 in a BIG way. One of the employees of the current concessionaire told me they will no longer be using Roger's Park for boat take-out and shuttle service. Private property has been obtained, where after launching at the State Park headwaters, boats and renters will be picked up and transported back to State Park - you will only be going 1/2 WAY now, 2-3 miles!! Persons with their own kayaks/canoes may still launch at State Park, and go all the way to Roger's Park, but must arrange their own self-shuttle. Private boats may NOT take out at the half-way point. Seems the launch fee will remain the same $10, for fewer services.

3/7/2020,Okay so Weeki Wachee park with the mermaids is am awesome show to see and my neice was one of the mermaids not to long ago but then they shut down for repairs for awhile and not sure if they reopened or not but the Buccaneer Bay side is awesome for kids to go to but the water is very cold because its a spring so be prepared. As far as the river it is a beautiful place to see with so much history also but it has became overcrowded with rude and non caring kayak & canoe people EVERYWHERE!! It is very difficult to take even a small boat down or up the river because the people in kayaks and canoes are ALWAYS in the way and dont yield to motor boats or even try to get out of the way at all they stop and look around in the middle of river and they have caused a lot of aggravation to people who live on the river as well leaving garbage in river and not obeying property signs or rules of the river including touching manatees. It is a perfect river to kayak and such but they need to be more considerate of others and not steal from property owners which I have also witnessed people taking inner tubes or kayaks right off their docks. NOT GOOD.. and the worst part of it all is at the dock.

2/7/2020,"Visited on a quiet Friday, the last week of January. The park was not crowded. Saw both the Little Mermaid and the Wonders of Weeki Mermaid Shows.  The mermaid shows are worth all the effort it takes to get there. The day we visited there were visitors from Canada, Sweeden, Peru, Gambia and about 25 states from around the country. The show has been going on for 73 years; please take time to talk to the Mermaids as you enter or exit the show, they are a wealth of information and so friendly.  And the best seats for the show are the first rows right next to the viewing windows.  The springs are amazing, the water crystal clear. The are other things you can do at the park, depends on the time of year you go and the weather. The Mermaid Show is definitely a Florida Treasure.

10/8/2019,"'m not sure this place wants you to actually know the name. It used to be called Boating in Florida, their fb page is Weeki Fresh Water Adventures and couldn't find it on Trip Advisor. Hopefully with their poor SEO, no one will be able to find this place to book it. I have kayaked with this outfit many times. (back when it was Boating in Florida and recently with them since they no longer allow Kayak Shack to launch from the State Park) I will not be back to the Weeki Fresh Water Adventures through the State Park. The past two times I have had horrible customer service. Last time we rented close to the new rules on no temporary containers - this was not prominently displayed on their website. After I checked in, I made a trip across the street to Dollar General and spent $25 on reusable containers. (the girl that checked me in wanted me to buy six of their water bottles at $14 each!). When we got to the launch site, imagine my surprise when the people in front of us had chips and snack bags and Publix plastic bags...and they allowed them to go after explaining the new rule...but we will let you slide! If you are going to enforce the rule, ensure you enforce for everyone. Now to today's adventure in poor customer service. Have all my reusable containers - even took a lipton green tea bottle in the car and poured into my reusable bottle. Got up for them to check our bags - and the man has what looks like a flashlight and he is checking alcohol content in containers. My lipton green tea set off his alert on the alcohol contraption. Not sure if that thing went green, yellow and then red....but it was going on and off between green and a line of yellow. After going back and forth with him, the people in line behind me were yelling ""he's just doing his job, you are holding up the line"". I was not the one holding up the line - he was holding up the line with his system of checking alcohol. Put another person out there or have him call a manager if there is an issue. I poured out the tea. Fast forward to the end of the trip waiting for the bus and the same people that were yelling at me were now talking about me and I assured them it was tea - but I don't care I can handle the bullying - the issue was they had chip bags, candy bars in the wrappers, and an entire bag of plastic and paper and a can of soda. How did they allow this to get on the river?For $40 I expect clean restrooms, clean kayaks, clean life vests and drip guards. The restrooms in the checkin area hadn't seen a toilet brush in weeks or months, the life vest smelled like a men's locker room, the kayak was not clean as my shorts smelled something nasty when I was done, and I was wet the entire trip due to no drip guards on the paddles.I will not be back to to rent or launch from the State Park.",Jennifer K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Winter Garden,Florida,United States,Weeki Wachee Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews

5/14/2020,"My boyfriend and I love classic kitschy attractions so we definitely wanted to check out the infamous Weeki Wachee mermaids! After arriving excitedly, we were informed that half of their attractions were already booked for the day or closed. It was only an hour after opening so this was confusing and disappointing. It didnt seem overly busy or crowded, but each show/attraction had a very small seating area and people were clamoring over each other for seats after waiting in queue lines for upwards of 45 minutes. The shows/attractions are scheduled at awkward times that makes you feel like you need to rush from place to place. The staff warned us that everything is first-come, first-served so we felt extraordinary pressure to get places extra early and wait in lines just to make sure we wouldn't miss out. It's clear the attractions are run by the state park service and the place is definitely lacking a customer focused approach based on the long lines and frusterated people we witnessed. However, the ranger show was funny and educational. Even though we were told the boat ride was booked, we were able to talk one of the employees into letting us on the boat because a few people didn't show up. The river ride was beautiful, breezy, and relaxing, but short. The entire waterpark was closed due to the season, which was disappointing since it was spring break. I thought we'd at least be able to stick our toes in the springs, but no such luck. The mermaid show was the definite highlight of the day! After waiting outside in line for 30 long, hot, boring minutes, we were ushered into a theatre instantly filled to capacity where we still had to wait another 15 minutes for the show to start. But that part went quick because they played fascinating classic black and white clips of mermaid shows from decades past. When the show started, we were blown away! It was so much better than we even expected and worth the admission price alone. It was honestly truly magical and you have to see it to believe it!  I give the mermaids themselves and the show 5 stars, but the confusing way the park is run lowers my rating.",jewelnev03,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Wisconsin,Wisconsin,United States,Weeki Wachee Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews
3/13/2020,"Weeki Wachee Springs has been around a long time but was commercialized in 1947 when Nate Perry created the underwater mermaid show.  The Springs is now owned by the state park system and is unique in that it has a water park, river boat ride, reptile show and mermaid show.  Entrance is very reasonable at $13/adult, $8 for children 6-12 yo, free for younger children.  The river boat trip is on the half hour and gets filled quickly so get your name on the list early.  There are three mermaid shows 11a, 1:30pm and 3pm, people tend to line up early.  The reptile show is 10-12-2:15pm.  We enjoyed all the shows especially the mermaid show.  The boat ride was short; we saw some birds and turtles.  We did not take advantage of the water park area,  but the spring water temp is always 72-74 degrees so nice on a hot day.

8/5/2020,"We camped at Wekiwa earlier this summer and had a great time. The spring is COLD but the water is beautifully clear. The campground was extremely clean and well maintained with large and private sites. There are trees in between. I don't like feeling like you can look right into your neighbor's camper. The campground around a mile from the spring. it's a very nice hike if you want to walk it but can be a bit far if you're carrying a lot of beach stuff. We rented a kayak and went down the river where we saw all sorts of different animals. An otter even swam right up into the spring while we were swimming!The only reason it gets a 4 is that it seemed very crowded when we were there but it's summer so that's probably to be expected. Since there were a lot of people, it was a little difficult to find a comfortable spot, bathrooms were a bit dirtier than usual, and there were two groups who were absolutely blaring their music.

We saw plenty of beautiful deer every morning and evening.  The mothers all seemed to be pregnant.  Also saw a lot of gopher tortoises, we removed from the road so they wouldn't be hit by cars.  Also, had a juvenile in back of our RV and it had its burrow there also.  They had a bear in camp the day before we got there.  Nothing to be afraid of if you respect them.  A friend of mine sees Fox Squirrels there a lot.  If you go out of the park and down the way you will come to Wekiva Island.  They have an outside bar, and a small place that serves great food.  You can sit there and eat beside the river and watch for wild life and watch the kayaks go by.  You can rent kayaks or launch your own there.

5/15/2019,"We camped at Wekiva Springs State park over Mother's Day weekend and beyond. Growing up in Orlando, it had been over 20 years since I had visited the Springs. We camped in our 32 ft C-Class RV with a tow car. OH wow!  What a pleasant surprise. Check-in was fast and friendly. The camp sites are all large and well kept with plenty of room for everything. The bathrooms are clean with plenty of hot water for showers, yep those long showers that are not possible most RVs!As could be expected, the Springs were very crowded Sunday and Saturday. Actually, I think it would have been crowded even if it was not a holiday weekend. Summer time is a busy time there I'll bet. The camp sites are about a mile from the Springs and very private and were not crowed at all. Seems most people had dogs at their campsites.....I LOVED IT!   And yes, as some people have said at couple of sites at one end you can see the road and the roofs of some houses in the far distance.   NO big deal, I still felt like I was in the woods. We visited the Springs in the early am and evening hours when virtually no one was there except for a few other nature lovers at times. It was truly a religious experience, so calm, peaceful and relaxing. The 71 degree water just takes all of the stress from your body. This is a great place for central Floridians who may want to get out of town, but camp close and relax in the wilderness with a nice natural water park within a brisk walk or bike ride away, ( about a mile.) Wekiva State Park Campground is one of the best kept secrets!Shhhh don't tell anyone.",Storm1of4,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Clermont,Florida,United States,Wekiwa Springs State Parktripadvisorreviews
4/29/2019,"Our day was spectacular. However, plan to be there at or before the park opens as there is usually a line of cars lined up to get in. You can't beat the price at only $6 a car load. There are hiking trails, water sports rentals (paddle boards, kayaks, canoes) to utilize. There is a huge picnic area with tables and grills for first come first serve. Once you drive into the parking lot, the springs are on your left. If you plan on cooking out and need a grill proceed to the end of the parking lot towards then end. That is a way shorter walk going that way. The water at the spring is wonderful. We went on a sunday and it was pretty packed. Overall, beautiful oasis in the middle of what most people would could a city. I would have never known this pace was there. Just a heads up. canopies are only allowed on the opposite side of the sidewalks. (SECRET, if you get there early enough, you can set your chairs next to the weater. On the left hand side, there is a little secluded ""island"" where I set up our chairs. It was awesome!!!!!)

4/22/2019,"Went to the swimming hole yesterday when the weather was a nice 77 degF. The water was cool but not icy. Loved it. The swimming hole edge is man made with the entire depth being around a comfy 4 feet. Keep in mind that this is not part of the river so the water is not flowing so you don't have any rapid like sections of slides. You also can't dive in as the water is shallow. However, the hole is cleared of trees so you don't see a lot of twigs or leaves in the water. And the water is clear and nice. The surrounding edge is good to sit and drink/eat listen to music. On the negative side the changing rooms were not good, was dark and smelled of pee. Would recommend changing in your individual vehicles.Overall a good day excursion to spend around an hour swimming around.

5/26/2019,"Sunday May 26, 2019 we arrived at Wekiwa Springs State Park only to find police blocking off the entrance. Obviously as tourists we were concerned and confused at the same time. We attempt to ask the officers to which they screamed, ""No, get moving."" We continued on to pull into a parking. Called the park to ask if there was a different entrance (thinking it was just some altercation with drivers just blocking the entrance) to which they replied that the parked was closed. Confused because the website stated they were open, we ask when they did open, and they crapply replied they were open today. So after many back in forths because I guess you have to know everything about how this park works, they just said it was parking that was full. So, for those who are NEW or Tourist, I'd call ahead to see if parking is open. Otherwise you'll be making a trip to sit outside a park that may not let you in for a few hours or even at all.

We showed up about 40 mins later, paid for two single kayaks and then found out they were out of paddles.... a kayak, SUP and canoe business was out of paddles. At the beginning of the season, they had plenty of vessels to rent, but not enough paddles. And they expected us to wait for an undetermined amount of tile for someone to hopefully come back so we could use paddles, however; there was already a line of people waiting for paddles. No thanks. We demanded a refund and a parking refund and left. We did our due diligence by calling ahead of time and were left incredibly disappointed on my birthday weekend.

That is a very nice selection during off-season in June. There was a lot of hiking so I recommend parking as close as possible to the hiking area, and staying very hydrated. We saw the springs section and the views from there and other areas inside the park were breathtaking. It is like visiting old Florida!

The paths are short, shade-filled, and with occasional little interesting tid-bits of information about the history or trees that are on the paths.  It is a nice walk, but beware of the roots on the paths.  Not a good place for wearing flip-flops, and I would not recommend this for older people with difficulty walking or little kids.  If you trip over those roots, and they are prevalent, there is nothing but hard coral underneath to land on.  I wasn't prepared.

2/7/2020,"We were returning to the mainland from Key West and wanted to see one more attraction before leaving. Saw the sign for this State Park with the intriguing name ""Geological Reef"", and couldn't resist stopping. The parking lot was barely full, (a usual thing for any educational attraction). We walked up to the entrance and entered the FREE part of the attraction, a small display of marine fossils and a short history of the building of the overseas railroad in the early 1900's. We spoke with the very knowledgeable park ranger and since the park had very short hiking trails, (nothing longer than ¬Ω mile we decided to pay the very small fee and view the quarry. The ranger offered a a guide book which coincided with the markers on the trails. It described in detail the native flora. We walked through the cool trees of the Windley trail until it intersected with the Quarry Trail which took us to the floor of the Quarry. The total distance of the hike was about a quarter mile. Once we reached the floor of the Quarry we spent about 45 minutes looking at the old and rusted quarry machinery, and at the many fossils in the stone floor and walls of the site. You should definitely have a camera with you as many of this fossils are unique to the Keys. There is an informative sign board with pictures of the various butterflies native to the area in this location as well. I managed to only capture a shot of the one shown here. We were glad we stopped. We learned a little about the area's history, saw some great fossils, and had a cool walk though the shaded woods, (called hammocks).

The ranger, who was cleaning the bathrooms, was not pleased to see us and said, ""Daycare is expensive.""  Apparently she needed to be at her daycare by a certain time, if she were late, she would be charged a large amount of money.  I get it.  People have been bad guests and have stayed past the 5 pm closing. However, she could have said the same thing in a much nicer tone.  In fact, more people came in some time after we did.We did a quick self-guided tour and were finished by 4:50.

Unfortunately, there is no proper listing (yet) here on Tripadvisor for the excellent bike shop I really intended to review.This review is VERY overdue but better late than never... I rent a bike nearly every time I go on a trip...and David's Cycle World in Inverness, FL is one of the best places I've rented from. Super easy to book online, excellent customer service, AWESOME communication, very fair prices, and very fine bikes. All of which adds up to...no wasted time and more ride time! (And oh, BTW, there's a cool 50+ miles of continuous bike paths about 50 feet from their door, so there's very little time spent navigating as well). Today was about the 5th time visiting, and all the experiences have been consistently excellent. Hats off to Ashley and the David's World team for operating a great bike shop.

Known as the cigar capital of the world, Ybor offers you a view into the past.  Learn about the rich history of the area with one of the knowledgeable park guides. Watch a short video that explains the diverse cultures that came together to settle this unique area. You'll see how the city was founded, a brief history of Cuba's fight for independence from Spain and the men and women who fought to make it happen. You will learn how and why the cigar industry enticed immigrants to this undeveloped and primitive area, the skills they learned, the important role the social clubs played in the lives, and about the ethnic diversity that lived in harmony and worked together to create a rich city and industry. Adjacent to the museum are several original Casitas to tour.  These were the affordable houses built for the families of cigar workers, near the cigar factories, to make life easier for the workers while insuring productivity.  There is also a small shaded park with benches and local flora. This site is part of the State Park system, so bring your annual park pass if you have one.
