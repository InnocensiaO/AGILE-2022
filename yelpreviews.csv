3/18/2019,This is our favorite place to camp...It's quiet and peaceful at night..The swimming area is nice. A lot of trails to walk and history to explore..,Tammy W.,5 star rating,"Bonifay, FL","Coconut Creek, FL",Falling Waters State Park,yelp
3/18/2019,"This is a sweet park. Lots of hiking trails, easy to medium, no big hills. Really pretty natural Florida wildlife flora and fauna. There are camping faculties on the property too (I didn't camp while I was there, just walked). There are paved and natural trails.",Brenda B.,4 star rating,"FL, FL","Gainesville, FL",Highlands Hammock State Park,yelp
3/19/2019,I love love love this place. I have been two times now and each time was a blast. I love going to the second entry into the water on a tub and floating down the spring. It feels just like a lazy river. The day we went there was even a manatee who swam down to the swimming area and everyone had to get out. It was Truly a sight to see. I also love the fact they have food on site. I got the jolly rancher popsicle and loved it ! If your looking for something fun to do I highly recommend this place!,Breanna C.,5 star rating,"Titusville, FL","St. Augustine, FL",Blue Spring State Park,yelp
3/19/2019,"Just so you know... I'm not from the area. Coming here from California I wasn't really sure what to expect when I landed in Jacksonville with my parents. I honestly thought saw this area as just a rest stop to my destination in Georgia. But this morning, Fort Clinch proved me wrong. Tipped off from a woman who did ecological tours I came across the State park and was apprehensive; I wasn't sure if going to a Fort would be interesting. Yet the beautiful canopies and the amazing bird life drew me in. And the visitor center and the Fort tour was just amazing! I'm a huge history buff so actually being able to not just look at artifacts from that time but to be in the literal building (and be able to touch it) was astounding.The only way I could describe the experience of walking in the Fort is probably surreal. I've never felt so close and yet so far to the past. The metal bars from the prison area were haunting and sent chills down my spine, as the bastions made my heart race as I overlooked the coast. What really tied it all together was the man dressed in a soldier uniform in the gift shop. He really made the history come alive for me and I'm grateful and glad he puts his time in into the park. A fantastic 5/5!",Hannah R.,5 star rating,"Stockton, CA","Columbia, SC",Fort Clinch State Park,yelp
3/20/2019,"What a wonderful, peaceful retreat.  It is set in gorgeous grounds that also has a  majestic lodge hotel.  There is water to swim in and also a boat tour which lasts approx 55 minutes to go on, which takes you on an approx 3 mile trip - going up the lake and following the springs and back again.  This boat trip costs 8 dollars and is a definite must do, whilst there.  My son and I saw alligators, loads of different birds, manatees and turtles.  You also have a narrator explaining all about the wildlife, the area, the history , which was fun and very informative.",Sarah P.,5 star rating,"Miami Lakes, FL","Columbia, SC",Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park,yelp
3/20/2019,"When we  got to the park, they had actives for movies. There were bunch of families and  pop corn served as well. It's the historical place, you still can  read the  history of the building . We will come back during the daytime.",Supawat J.,5 star rating,"Miami, FL","Columbia, SC",The Barnacle Historic State Park,yelp
3/21/2019,This is such a pretty park. The ability to go into the under water viewing area was so interesting. We were at the park when they were guiding the injured manatees into the area where they were fed.  This park sits along the Crystal River where there is a family of manatees that have chosen to live there. We watched them for awhile and really enjoyed their antics.,Pat R.,5 star rating,"Souderton, PA","Las Vegas, NV",Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park,yelp
3/22/2019,"What hidden gem! Amazing spring, serene environment, and family friendly atmosphere. Our first time visiting we will definitely be back in the summer.",Francis F.,5 star rating,"Thousand Oaks East, Trinity, FL","Las Vegas, NV",Rainbow Springs State Park,yelp
3/23/2019,Manatees will b seen! If you are patient you can even see the elusive Florida scrub jay! Arive before 10 on the weekend to beat the crowds cuz the park will close to visitors to prevent overcrowding!,Jay R.,4 star rating,"Mount Pleasant, SC","Las Vegas, NV",Blue Spring State Park,yelp
3/23/2019,"We got more than we bargained for. There are a great many sights to see, and it's largely staffed by knowledgable volunteers. The boat ride is certainly a highlight. The native Floridian fauna is quite interesting. Kids of all age are welcome. One can easily spend the entire day here.",Aaron M.,5 star rating,"Orange Park, FL","Las Vegas, NV",Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park,yelp
3/24/2019,"My first time ever setting foot on the Key was quite satisfying, especially since the goal was to make it to this awesome park. After arriving here, I knew it was a big place, but I never imagined it being as big as it is with so many different areas. To begin, there is the beach area on the east side that seems to stretch for miles. The natural vegetation that nestles right up the wide beach and that beautiful blue Atlantic water was just filled with visitors enjoying the picturesque day. As you continue to explore on foot, or bike (my preference), you can get to the smaller park surrounding the lighthouse. If you have the time, you can take guided tours, and wait your turn to walk up the lighthouse as well. The line was too long on this visit for me, but the lighthouse is definitely very cool, and you can still learn a lot about it with all of the placards around the area. There are tons of fishing piers along the shore line, some nice trails for biking and walking as well with plenty of things to see and people to meet. There's the Boater's Grille that is nestled up to the No Name Harbor to grab a bite to eat, too. Boaters can park their boats in the Harbor overnight as well, probably for a nominal fee. I really enjoyed my visit and would definitely come back again for an extended stay some time in the future.",Kevin G.,5 star rating,"Naples, FL","Las Vegas, NV",Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park,yelp
3/24/2019,"Love this state park! Beautiful fresh water springs, where you can snorkel, swim and scuba dive. The spring closes for water activities during the winter months because the protected Florida Manatees take refuge from the cold at the springs usually between Nov - March. During the winter the park is perfect to see the manatees while you enjoy a stroll or jog.",Ana W.,5 star rating,"Orlando, FL","Saint Augustine, FL",Blue Spring State Park,yelp
3/24/2019,"Rented two cabins. They where in a disgusting state of dis-repair, black mold growing in the corners of the cabins, spray foam was used to patch holes all over the cabins. The bathrooms that where closets to us had every single toilet clogged. When I asked the front desk to clean it they gave me a plunger. Pool smelled more like warm piss than chlorine. Won't be back",James B.,1 star rating,"Livonia, MI","Fish Hawk, Lithia, FL",Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park,yelp
3/24/2019,"We stayed here in our trailer in November 2018.  The park is beautiful; staff are great; and bathhouse was one of the cleanest and nicest we have ever seen.  4 stars instead of 5 because there is no dump station.  We had no idea until leaving, since we had never before encountered this in a campground with RV spaces!  The nearest dump was miles away, so we carried our waste until we found a rest area with dump station.  Stressful and inconvenient ending to a great stay!",Robin B.,4 star rating,"Livingston, KY","Saint Augustine, FL",Gilchrist Blue Springs State Park,yelp
3/24/2019,"Great park and the only place I've gone kayaking for years. Just know that if you arrive anywhere near 11:00 on weekends the line of cars to get into the park might reach onto the road. It's happened to me more than once. The entry fee is $4 for solo and $6 for double passengers. There is a small beach, bike trails, canoe and kayak rentals, bike rentals, and more. The kayak rental process is usually quick but you need to sign a waiver upstairs first. I enjoy kayaking through the mangroves BUT sometimes there are so many mosquitoes and you're stuck. So now I always bring bug spray.",Lauren G.,5 star rating,"Miami, FL","Gainesville, FL",Oleta River Outdoor Center,yelp
3/25/2019,"Beautiful, clean and neighborly beach. I highly suggest checking out the lighthouse tour (only during select hours) and then snapping a shot with it in the background while you are on the beach. Chairs and umbrellas are available for rent $Beware that when you grill out in this area there are lots of raccoons. Generally they seem more pesky than harmful. Just be mindful when brining small children or dogs.",Kyla-Emman N.,5 star rating,"Miami, FL","Jacksonville, FL",Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park,yelp
3/25/2019,Great Spring. In March we were excited to see a few manatees with my mom. Her wish was always to see a large mamal in the water and that dream was fufilled. You can rent blow up floaters here and float for a very short distance. Arriving at noon in Late Spring on a monday presented no problems for parking.,Eleanor G.,5 star rating,"Miami Beach, FL","Fulton, NY",Blue Spring State Park,yelp
3/27/2019,"Awesome place to take a walk on the beach. Compared the little Talbot, you couldn't swim here. The trees on the shore is a spectacular view. You can see people playing on the sand, sun tanning or fishing. You donate $3 at the entrance and get a parking tag. It wasn't much of a trail to walk.",Xinran Z.,5 star rating,"Jacksonville, FL","FL, FL",Big Talbot Island State Park,yelp
3/27/2019,"Recommended to come here and go for a walk, especially during manatee season! They are adorable sea cows and it's nice area. I came here during the week and it was very quiet nice and early in the morning. The state park does get busy during manatee season so plan accordingly and come early. Saw lots of fish and squirrels too. Park is also dog friendly, as long as you have them on a leash!",Krista D.,5 star rating,"Lake Mary, FL","Warner Robins, GA",Blue Spring State Park,yelp
3/27/2019,"We've been lucky enough to stay right near this little slice of beach heaven multiple times. The beach is large and there is a lot of it to walk (miles!). Only two sets of bathrooms; one at the main beach and then one at the entrance of the park. They are not close to one another.  Parking is SLIM after about 11am since it fills up quickly, probably the only downsize to that area. The beach itself is walking distance to multiple beach shops, bars, restaurants and a corner store. The sand is soft and clean and the water is almost see thru. It feels a little like Bermuda! Great spot to watch the sunset! We've seen so many dolphins and bald eagle in that area. The pass is gorgeous from the beach or parked on a boat for the day. It gets a little busy on weekends but don't let it deter you if you have never been. If you want to walk the whole park I would suggest shoes since there are some spots full of shells. If you can walk it it's absolutely worth it!",Rachel P.,4 star rating,"Burnt Hills, NY","Forest City, NC",Stump Pass Beach and Park,yelp
3/27/2019,This is a really great campground it is so great that our camper was naturally level when we parked making it a great place to set up in at 9:30 at night. The bathrooms are really nice lots of stalls the only problem was that tents were not allowed off the gravel so you had very little place to keep everything.,Kathryn D.,5 star rating,"Port Orange, FL","Jacksonville, FL",Wekiwa Springs State Park,yelp
3/28/2019,"Great walking/hiking trail at this park. However, to enter the long 4.5 mile walking path, you don't need/want to enter the park at the main entrance (which costs $5 per car). The entrance for the trail is just east of the park entrance on the opposite side of the road. So, we paid $5 to realize we were in the wrong place for the hike we wanted to take.",Wallace G.,4 star rating,"Chesterfield, MO","Bradenton Beach, FL",Grayton Beach State Park,yelp
3/28/2019,"State park is gorgeous. There are trials to walk and a beautiful spring to swim in. There are also kayaks and canoe rentals as well. You can see a lot of nature and enjoy animal watching. The last time I went on one of the paths, I saw a beautiful deer up close. One time kayaking, I did see a gator up close, so again- be careful with the nature! This place is so quiet early in the morning before a lot of people show up. This park can fill up in summer busy seasons.",Krista D.,5 star rating,"Lake Mary, FL","High Springs, FL",Wekiwa Springs State Park,yelp
3/29/2019,"Honestly, I expected so much more from the park. From the moment we entered we were underwhelmed, not only by the lack of scenery but by how confusing it was to find any parks within the park. I brought my dog here a few times and she enjoys roaming the wide open fields but don't come expecting much more. Beautiful lake spots and many boat ramps if that's your thing. However I won't be returning for anymore walks/ scenery alone.",Beatrice C.,2 star rating,"Summerville, SC","Gainesville, FL",Lake Louisa State Park,yelp
3/29/2019,Its not bad. Nice walk area. Not as good as the many free nature preserves around. It was $8 parking for here and the beach. On a cloudy day the beach lot was full. Ton of better options around,jon g.,3 star rating,"Salem, NH","Wilmington, NC",Lovers Key State Park,yelp
3/29/2019,"This is one of the best camping spots in south(ish) FL. Gorgeous hardwoods, a decent kayak trail, and the Florida trail runs through the park. Bring a bike, it's great to park the car at the campsite and bike everywhere else. You can stop anywhere along the main road, park, and just walk into the woods. The campgrounds are great, large and shady. Or you can take a backpack and primitive camp elsewhere in the park.",Heather S.,5 star rating,"Jackson, MS","Altamonte Springs, FL",Myakka River State Park,yelp
3/29/2019,$6 for lazy river?   Disappointing.  Water BEAUTIFUL!  Mermaids ‍ came out for a meet and greet/swim even though Mermaid Auditorium was being renovated which was AWESOME!!,Carrie B.,3 star rating,"CANADIAN LAKE, MI","Altamonte Springs, FL",Weeki Wachee Springs,yelp
3/30/2019,Great facility for boat docking and transportation on the hour to the Gulf side of the island.  This was a nice way to get to the gulf side beach on a very windy day.,Frank N.,4 star rating,"Dublin, OH","Altamonte Springs, FL",Cayo Costa State Park,yelp
3/30/2019,Used to be great until the state bought it. No more platform to jump off of. Barely a boardwalk anymore. Can't wade down to the river like you used to be able to. Water is beautiful but not much to do anymore. Kind of like Poe springs now.,Dana F.,1 star rating,"Newberry, FL","Altamonte Springs, FL",Gilchrist Blue Springs State Park,yelp
3/31/2019,"Coming from Fl 24, there is a signage on the side leading to this hidden park which to be honest feels like a privately owned park because no one is there. What is interesting is that it is a  Florida scrub reserve meaning the ecosystem is different as it is arid and landscape is completely different than other parks around Florida. Plants are mostly oaks and shrubs as may be due to low nutrients of the sandy soil and usually dry. Since we are the only ones around, we felt a bit afraid to go past the corner of the trail. This place is deserted but at least there is a bathroom that is generally clean and accessible.",Amber R.,3 star rating,"Tampa, FL","Newark, DE",Cedar Key Scrub State Reserve,yelp
3/31/2019,Simply Beautiful!!!! best Beach in Key West bonus is the Fort Zachary monumental park. Water is crystal clear and lots of shade and picnic tables.,Amy C.,5 star rating,"Carlsbad, NM","Yulee, FL",Fort Zachary Taylor State Park Beach,yelp
3/31/2019,"Admission was at a good price and the underwater dome was our favorite part. However, there is an abundance of ""parents"" not watching their children and letting them run around, throw toys, climb fences, and generally not follow rules. Park staff should monitor this better, as it is not only annoying to other visitors, but also a safety issue. We would have loved to stay longer but due to the above mentioned issue we decided to leave. Other than that, the park is beautiful.",Jenna Z.,3 star rating,"Spring Hill, FL","Westport, MA",Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park,yelp

3/31/2019,"We rented a cabin for three nights in Stephen Foster Park for a long weekend getaway. The park is beautiful. There is a carillon tower that plays music at different times throughout the day, a museum with some cool dioramas and lots of information about Stephen Foster himself, the Florida Trail can be accessed within the park, and it's also along the Suwannee River so you can rent a canoe there, or elsewhere or bring your own canoe or kayak to launch. The grounds are very peaceful and quiet. The rangers were all very friendly. Shout out to Brandy who was the first ranger we encountered who told us how to check in and she also ran an interesting presentation on the Mexican free tailed bat on Saturday evening. We got to see a lot of bats as they exited the bathouse for their nightly dinner. The cabins themselves are spacious and very clean and cozy. There's a kitchen with a large fridge and freezer so you can bring groceries to prepare meals for an extended stay. They stock most basic cookware and dishes, but some of it isn't the best so if you are going to do a ton of cooking, you might want to bring some of your own cookware and utensils, particularly good knives. However, it was perfectly adequate and I had no issues preparing food with what was available. The beds also are kind of uncomfortable. I'd suggest bringing your own pillow and maybe a pillow top for the mattress if you have one. Again though, it was still really clean and nice and I'd absolutely recommend it for the price! The surrounding town is short on stuff to do, but we had fun exploring the trail, the park grounds, and the river for the three days we were there. It was a great amount of time to explore and get away from the typical hustle and bustle of the city.",Melinda S.,5 star rating,"Orlando, FL","Jacksonville, FL",Stephen Foster Folk Culture State Park,yelp

3/31/2019,Beautiful state park! I could be a little biased considering I used to work for the state park system! I came to this one for a late night/after hours party last night; which was very cold! Apparently there was also a wedding going on too last night. The gate attendant was super friendly and very informative. He made us feel very welcomed. Made sure that we knew where we were going and provided us with directions. The beach itself was beautiful. My son was very eager to get in the water with his shirt and shorts. I would certainly come back to this location just to experience it in the day time and the beach.,Brittany W.,5 star rating,"Miami, FL","Pembroke Pines, FL",Von D.

4/4/2019,"Better to come here on a nice sunny day. $6 per vehicle entrance. 3 mile drive to the visitor center. There's hiking trails, bike riding, picnic benches, and beaches. At the end Amelia island where you can see Cumberland island. The entrance fee is for all day even if you leave the park and come back.",Nancy R.,3 star rating,"Atlanta, GA","Pembroke Pines, FL",Fort Clinch State Park,yelp
4/4/2019,Wow what's killer little state park on Key West. Great fees of clear blue water and if you've brought a hammock you can lay between the palm trees. Several picnic benches are around but your gonna have to fiat fight someone for those spots. Plenty of parking should you have a car. If your visiting the Fort well you'll pass that on the way to the beach. Bring the sunscreen and some tasty beverage to waist your day away.  Cause nothing beats a day of doing nothing laying on a sandy beach.,Frank B.,5 star rating,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA","Orlando, FL",Fort Zachary Taylor State Park Beach,yelp
4/4/2019,"This park is wonderful for watching wild life and riding bikes, you can take a ride on the lake and they will take you around an show you the whole place, price is not bad.The only thing I think they should update is there garbage bin...They are not the ones that keep the Racoons out, an with that said they just are all over if your camp site is like across the street from the garbage.So I would hope in the near future they would update that.But very nice park, a lot of gators.I would visit again..:)Toni Grace4/04/2019",Toni G.,4 star rating,"Bartow, FL","Pittsburgh, PA",Myakka River State Park,yelp
4/4/2019,My favorite spring I've been to so far as a Florida native. Plenty of trails to explore and little waterfalls sprinkled along the way. The main swimming area is somewhat small but the water is crystal clear and blue and beautiful. I love kayaking down the rainbow river. The path is lined with beautiful homes and trees and wildlife and is extremely peaceful. You can see through the clear water and if you're lucky you might spot a baby gator!,Michelle M.,5 star rating,"Alafaya, FL","Miami, FL",Rainbow Springs State Park,yelp

4/5/2019,"Another State Park in Florida that deserves a good review. People that run this place are very nice indeed and it is quite peculiar to hear the Carillon from the site, no matter how far you are from the cultural center. No full hookups here but that is ok because we just wanted to overnight and keep driving next morning.8 stars for the gentleman that goes around and delivers the firewood, great personality and very friendly, had a big fire that evening but mosquitoes had the best of us regardless of some smoke and heat. Had to be early on the road next morning so we missed the museum, did I say museum? can you believe that? a State Park with a Museum on site.

4/6/2019,"We did an overnight stay at Myakka River State Park in March ... this is a beautiful park ... and huge ... if you're camping, you'll need a car or golf cart to get around and explore the different sections.  We stayed in site 79, which had 20/30/50 AMP power, H2O hookups and it's own sewer hookup ... we couldn't use the sewer hookup because it was ~12 inches high, so ended using the dump site at the end of the trip.This park has some really good trails ... the rive trail is pretty long and one way (not a loop) ... so you have to 180 in order to make it back to the start point ... this trail runs along the river ... tons of wild palms and you'll see some good gators.There's also a shorter Nature Trail ... maybe a 1.5 mile loop ... that splits off to what they call the Canopy Walk ... which is a wooden suspension bridge between two towers ... the bridge takes you through the canopy to the tower on the other side ... which is ~75-100 feet high ... climb that tower and you're above the canopy and can see for miles ... it's excellent, so if you hit Myakka, don't miss this.The park also has a small Outpost Store that has would and supplies (cash only) ... there's a diner on the river ... and more trails that run along the wider parts of the river ... there, you will see gators everywhere.I love Florida State Parks ... this one is awesome ... and we'll be back!  You can see our video here youtube.com/watch?v=_6ru…",Thomas M.,5 star rating,"Tampa, FL","Madison, AL",Myakka River State Park,yelp

4/7/2019,"This is such a perfect place to hike, head for the beach or just climb aboard a kayak and paddle board and cruise around the placid waterfront.Not only is it beautiful here, it is beautifully maintained. Lots of picnic tables to enjoy eating whatever feast you may pack or you can bring along your favorite foods to barbecue.You can rent kayaks and paddle boards, purchase necessities like sun and bug protection or buy snacks and cold drinks here so be sure to bring money or credit cards.A recent Saturday visit enabled our group to arrive on the first ferry of the day and enjoy a quick walk to the beach and a hike along the nature trail. We then embarked on kayaks to paddle through the mangroves. It was a pleasantly breezy morning and the mangroves provided just the right amount of shade to make the trip truly a pleasure.Our hike along the trail made it feel like we had the entire island to ourselves. Eventually we crossed paths with a couple but that was it as far as other foot traffic goes.It is such a pleasure to roam around a naturally beautiful spot, see birds and turtles in their natural habitat and not be subjected to the noises other than those that emit from the environment.This is a paradise and just the sort of place that makes Florida such a treasure.",Mary J.,5 star rating,"Tampa, FL","Gainesville, FL",Caladesi Island State Park,yelp

It doesn't have septic at each camp site but they do have a dump station. The sites are absolutely beautiful. Every morning and evening we would see deer, Turkeys etc in our campsite. It's very lush and shaded. Great access to the lake. Great fishing, kayaking, hiking. It's far out and not very close to amenities so be prepared or be ready for a drive.

4/9/2019,"This place has been one of my favorites to Kayak and the best part of it all is you can bring your dog! I've been there a handful of times and one tip everyone should know, especially if you're like me and you get eaten alive by bugs. Do not go there late or stay out around sundown. There were little bugs bitting me all over in the water while I was kayaking. Besides that, go earlier. The car line getting into the park usually takes long and there is a fee. Prices to go kayaking aren't cheap either, that's why I recommend everyone to go earlier to enjoy a full days worth. There's a little beach which is pretty cool because there isn't any waves so my dogs love to go swimming. I'm not sure if you're allowed to bring your dog there but my dogs never bother other people. I know you can go mountain biking but I'm not knowledgeable on that since I've never seen a trail. I have seen some marine life in the water, jellyfish and stingrays so be careful where you step.

4/12/2019,"Met up with an old friend who lives here. She told us about Caladesi and of course googled it. After seeing pics-we we're hooked! It was maybe a 30-40 minute drive from our hotel in Clearwater. Park entry is currently $8 per car (4-8 personas). To get to the actual island, you have to ferry. We had a coupon for $1 off each ticket which we found in a tourist brochure. Being a state park, of course, comes with guidelines to protect the wildlife and there are signs to help you remember! The ferry goes over every 1/2 hr and tickets are color coded for times to return but you can come back early if the ferry isn't crowded. (They only sell tickets for the ride over when the ferry is ready & not before so no pre-ticket sales) we took tons of food, unfortunately, we forgot the lighter/matches to light the charcoal none of us smoke...there is a very crowded concession stand but our sides and junk food held us over! We actually rented a pavilion for $30 which had 6 picnic tables. We had no idea it was so big (only 4 of us) and a little ways from the actual beach! We thought about buying beach chairs and an umbrella but decided to rent as we'd have to donate or throw away since we flying home. However, didn't think it would cost $52+! 50 for 4 chairs and an umbrella, plus a $2 beach fee.

4/14/2019,"I love this State Park! Parking (in the lot nearest to the Nature Center) was simple. The shadiness of the lots allow you to unload/load children and/or strollers, etc, as needed.The Nature Center is small, but the displays seem modern. I recall: aquariums, a couple of caged snakes, a manatee skeleton, drawers of items found on the beach, interactive interpretive displays about dolphins and sea turtles. Two very nice people working at the Center came out to show us their favorite things about the center, pointing things out with enthusiasm. Thank you!My kids and I embarked on the long boardwalk path to the beach-side of the park. In the past, pre-kids, I found this walk somewhat tedious, as I just wanted to get to the beach. Now, I find this path delightful, the walking version of driving to the Keys, with water all around us. At the end, we checked out the Dune Hammock trail. My standard stroller made it mostly fine the whole way, despite it being an unpaved path. Tree markers helped identify plants along the way. A couple of benches here and there provided for our picnic dinner. At the end of the trail is an older wooden building, a shower, and stairs to climb up to the beach. The emptiness of the beautiful beach was pretty cool, and seeing the woods behind us (instead of condos) was refreshing!Last but not least, the bathrooms (next to the Nature Center) are large and clean. After visiting them, I let my kids run and climb and 'perform' in the amphitheater pit. I was conscious that if it began to rain, this covered area is perfect for kids to still be able to get energy out and be kind of outdoors still.All this, and we never even got to the other trail or the playground... next time!In the past, I have been to MacArthur for a beach wedding with a picnic pavilion party, to kayak the Intracoastal, and at a summer camp presentation: all enjoyable and memorable experiences.MacArthur is just a few minutes from all the good stuff that is 'Eastern Palm Beach Gardens': Carmine's, Doris Italian Market & Bakery and Olive U Mediterranean Grill, to name a few.

4/15/2019,"This state park located in Estero FL, between Fort Meyers and Naples, is definitely worth the visit and I am glad that I stopped there. The site was once home to the Koreshan religious community, a new religious movement operating in the later 1800s and which believed that the earth was located on the interior and not exterior of the planet. At the state park down the original homes of the community are preserved along with the bakery, industrial center and the impressive planetary house. The land is beautiful with nature trails, rivers and camping facilities. The guides on hand do a great job of explaining the history and significance of the park. I am so glad that efforts have been made to preserve the historical integrity of the site and that it is open and accessible to the public.

4/18/2019,"The park itself is beautiful.  However, 5 of us decided to do the river tour yesterday.  We spent 100 dollars to do so.  We get on the boat after paying, and are then informed on our way out that the water level is too low, so we're going to be skipping the vast majority of the tour.  The tour guide drove us straight across the lake, went about 200 yards downstream, then turned around and took us straight back.  He told us he would take both sides of the boat along the shoreline so everybody could see, then failed to do so.  We should have been notified before hand, and honestly should receive full refunds as the tour was in no way what was advertised.  If the water levels too low that's fine, but you need to make people aware before they shell out 3 figures for a severely shortened tour.  Also, the cafe was SWAMPED with tourists.  The cafe was INCREDIBLY understaffed.  We watched what must have been the manager treat her staff like garbage, despite the fact that the entire staff was hustling-so to the miserable lady in charge-when YOU fail to staff appropriately you don't get to treat people like crap.  Do your job better-because we all were feeling for the kids behind the counter.   It was pretty terrible.  I hope management reaches out, because this was a really bad experience.",Andrew V.,1 star rating,"Rochester, MI","Apopka, FL",Myakka River State Park,yelp

4/22/2019,"I'm proud to be an Floridian! There's a plethora of state parks, beaches, streets, homes, not to mention that many  have received the national treatment. Some of our beloved state parks are frequently visited with families soaking in that glorious year round sun, photographers capturing those candid moments of newly engaged couples and spontaneous picnic dates. Big Talbot Island is where the cool kids go, it's ok if you haven't been, the narrative can be changed. *FluffI believe Folgers says it best, ""The best part of waking up, is ..."" I'll change it to the 5am preparation for a drive out to catch sunrise, getting sand in my shoes and being the only person to soak in God's creation. During my visits to Big Talbot I'm always curious as to what new experiences I'll have. Will I stumble across a wild animal? Am I going to view one of the best sky displays of the year? When driving down Heckscher Dr, you'll have to be mindful of the entrance because you could miss it. Little Talbot appears first and Big Talbot a few miles down the road. When you approach the parking lot, there's a donation box to drop in the entrance fee. The majority of these parks go by the honor system, please, be honest. The beach portion of Big Talbot is considered the Boneyard Beach, boneyard in reference to the driftwood that stretches miles down the coastline. This is where the beach gets its character, very unique in its own right. Ideal for picking shells, bird watching, paddling and bicycling. It's not crowded like some of the other beaches in the city, people usually don't think to come here but that's why I enjoy it. It's family oriented and well taken care of, which is why I wrote this review on today. *Overall As of today, April 22, it's Earth Day! We've all heard growing up protect the planet but it's more relevant now than ever before. We have a generation that's swayed by technology and doesn't think twice about being outdoors.

I grew up here and have spent 20 years visiting this beautiful river. I visit many parks and natural places oftenWith no issues and nothing but respect for the environment... the racket they have here isn't worth the hassle. The ""no non-disposable"" policy is obnoxious and unreasonable. I had to leave behind my glucose bars for my blood sugar because they were wrapped in ""plastic""... not true. I explained they were necessary and was basically treated like a child and was told, take them out of the package or leave it behind.... The staff offered ZERO help to the two newbies I had with me and were only concerned They also force you to stress about time by threatening you with a $50.00 fine if you don't return in 4 hours. It is almost impossible to enjoy this river for all it has to offer if you paddle through in 4 hours. They simply care about making money only and making it as inconvenient as possible to enjoy this beautiful river... I used to recommend this venue to almost everyone who visits Florida. I will no longer offer it due to the lack of customer service and reasonableness. It's clear they only care about making money...spend your money elsewhere where you'll be treated properly and won't be subject to the punishment of ridiculous rules because of other people's poor behavior.

5/3/2019,Great place to go visit.Weather was overcast but from the Gate to the visitors center to the inside of the fort our experience was great!  Staff were informative and we spent at least an hour looking around this fort.  This fort had so much brick and tunnels etc and you got to walk through it all!Definitely a must see in Amelia Island.  Even the trails and biking and scenery were beautiful.There is a spot to stop and see the lighthouse too.,Rebecca S.,5 star rating,"FL, FL","Omaha, NE",Fort Clinch State Park,yelp

5/8/2019,"I came here because the beach in front of the hotel I was staying was stinky and awful with seaweed/garbage all over.      The road is tucked away and a little bit hard to find. It's next to a naval base.       We were charged $7.00 because it was a 2 person vehicle.       Parking was plentiful but definitely get there early as I can see if being full and having to parking in the gravel/fishing area.       There was a nice crowd on the beach.  Not too many people but a nice crowd.  What I like about this place is it had grills and picnic tables under trees where you can eat and relax.  You have to pick up your own trash as there is no trash cans. (I find this annoying as we are paying to get in.  The least they can do is offer us trash cans). There are restrooms, showers, and places where you wash your feet off.      This is not your normal white smooth sand beach. It's comprised of rocks.  So it maybe tricky to walk and find somewhere to lay down.  There as some seaweed but way less than Smather's beach.        The water was decently clear where you can see lots of little fish swimming around.  The ocean floor as well is very rocky and hard to walk.  I tripped a few times.  I went back to get my Crocs and was able to finally walk around comfortable.        The waters were calm unless boats passed by.  I didn't see much wild life here other than a few pelicans diving for fish which was awesome as they did it next to you.  And few small sea birds.           I didn't check out the fort area as the temps were hot and I need to get some tan on my pale body. Lol. I really enjoyed this beach and will definitely come back in the future.          This is a must to come beach if your in Key West.",Craig T.,5 star rating,"Duluth, GA","Winter Park, FL",Fort Zachary Taylor State Park Beach,yelp

The water was clear and beautiful, but overrun by kelp which probably was just season. Watch out for sand spurs when you get back on shore and go early!!

It looks like it's still a great place for kayaking and boating, but if you're here for the beach, there are nicer beaches to go to in the area. The entrance to come into the park is $6 per vehicle (up to 6 people) and parking is plentiful and easy. Once you arrive to the picnic area called the ""whiskey creek hideout"", you'll find plenty of picnic tables right by the beach. It really is a great location for family get togethers or birthday parties. I've always liked this beach as a kid friendly option. It's usually quieter and more peaceful than other beaches in Miami. While that is still true, there is SO much seaweed that we really could not enjoy our experience this time. I'm not sure why there is no maintenance, but it really ruined our family day here (see pics).

5/14/2019,"I love the outdoors and love history (not as much as my husband though). This State Park gives me both! As an annual pass holder, the fee was waived to enter the park and museum. I really enjoyed the high tech exhibits! There are circles on the floor in front of various displays and when you stand in proximity an audio tour is triggered- telling a story from the perspective of someone who lived in that time. Fort Mose surprised me with the Spanish history and the lure of freedom for many slaves held in English Colonies. This was the  first legally sanctioned free African settlement in what is now the United States. This enticed several revolts from slaves in colonies to the north- who wanted to flee and claim freedom. This history was very different- because it spoke of the black and brown people who came to this country free and accepted refugees and convicts (as they were called for abandoning their slave owners) from various other places. The only stipulation for gaining their freedom was that they had to declare their allegiance to the king of Spain and became members of the Catholic Church. A new culture was born here thanks to the African, Native American & Spanish & English influences. There is no structure, however the park is raising funds to build a replicate of the fort. I know that they offer reenactments, maybe we can make it down in the near future to experience one of those!

5/19/2019,"I have been to Blue Springs many, many times over the years.  And can say the vibe here is much different now that it is a Florida State Park.  The Good: there are a lot less drunk folks making bad decisions or causing scenes. The grounds look like they are better taken care of, and having law enforcement here in general as upped the anti - helping people have a good time with less risk. The Bad: two of the cool things about the park were the diving platform and the boardwalk going out to the Santa Fe River. There are a number of explanations going around at to why the diving platform and boardwalk are gone and seemingly not going to be repaired. It seems like just excuses to me. If the family who owned the land around the spring for so long could keep the platform and boardwalk going and in repair for many, many years -the State of Florida certainly can also. The Ugly: yesterday we were going to have a birthday party for my friends 2 year old, but found a big issue. There is seemingly a much small number of people allowed in the park now. 75 percent of the people who drove to the park for the party were sent away because they were not allowing anyone else in. I understand protecting the springs and resources, but this was unfortunate and turns out to be serious poor planning on our part. All in all - the State of Florida purchasing Blue Springs is a total Victory for the people and for the protection of the springs for generations to come. I put the information about the visitor limitations in this review so other people can plan better than we did, but I want to point out this review is 4 stars and is in no way a negative evaluation.

If you would rather be with more adults, I suggest going to Wekiva Island instead.The park is about a 45 minute kayak/canoe ride from Wekiva Island.

5/29/2019,"HORSEBACK RIDING review: My horseback riding experience was ok. Pros: -trail is beautiful and you get to see Florida, naturally! -trail/park is not touristy! -the horses go through water along the trail, after a hard rain (we did not get to see that, but still, pretty cool) -you might see some wildlife along the way: deer, turkey, birds, turtles, etc. -the trail is relatively quiet -horses were calm, and trained well Cons: -I had a Groupon and tried booking for 12:30 online. The code didn't work, so I called to book over the phone and the lady insisted we can only do 10:30, bc no one booked for 12:30, so they want back-to-back trail rides. I called twice to see if we could do 12:30. No. When we get there, we find out there was a 12:30 ride going after all. They booked online (not with a Groupon). -No phones allowed for pictures. I would have loved to capture some pictures of the beauty I saw. The trail itself is pretty flat and the ride was calm, but it wasn't allowed. I understand that it was for safety, but it would have been nice if the guides could take some. The guides only took our pics at the end, at a spot right next to the stables. Which, isn't as scenic as the rest of the trail -One of the guides was a bit rude, a tad bit of an attitude.",Roxy A.,3 star rating,"Orlando, FL","Oceanside, CA",Lake Louisa State Park,yelp

Second, the main road is super narrow (two cars can not pass each other) and the road in the actual campground is completely lined by trees that cause to you constantly swerve left and right while driving the loop so your trailer doesn't hit them.

My mom and I (both very athletic and great with direction) looped around 3 times in different places on the trail as there are NO direction signs anywhere and also trails people have made leading off the main trail. It is not clear at all what the main trail is and what is made by other people. Very nerve-racking as I continuously hike back home and have no problem navigating those trails. There is one sign warning about poisonous snakes and trees yet the trails are completely covered by shrubbery. Very disappointed in this trail as its been something I've always wanted to do.

6/17/2019,"The land the park sits on was first settled in 1881 by Jonathan Skipper on land that was known as Hooker's Hammock. Jonathan and his wife built a home and planted an orange grove. Jonathan and his family went on to raise cattle that they shipped to Cuba. By the 1920's Jonathan's son Chesley A. Skipper owned several hundred acres of the hammock. Donald Roebling was in the area to purchase a plane from the son of George Sebring whose father founded the town. Donald heard of the beautiful plants in the hammocks and he flew his parents in to view them. Impressed with what she saw Donalds mother who was the widow of the builder of the Brooklyn Bridge  purchased 500 acres for $25,000 in order to preserve it. A corporation formed in 1930 when local citizens who were concerned about plans to turn the hammock into farmland bought the property in order to protect it. Chesley A. Skipper donated 320 acres to form the park. Roads and bridges were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the park opened to the public in 1931.  They corporation had hoped to make it a national park but when Florida's state park system was created four years later in 1935 and Highlands Hammock became one of four original state parks. The Civilian Conservation Corps built a camp there as a base for development. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.Thanks to a group of nature conservationists in the 1930's you can visit the park today and see the way Florida looked before it was developed. Admission is $4 for a single occupant car and $6 if you have more than one person. It is such a small price to enjoy all the park has to offer. You can visit the Civilian Conservation Corps Museum which shows a 10 minute film that highlights their contributions to the park. The park also offers a $10 tram ride. It was closed when I visited but I want to come back for it because it takes you to parts of the park that you can't otherwise access. Other park activities include camping, biking, picnicking, and nature watching. Snacks can be purchased at the park store. My favorite part of the park is the hiking trails. There are 9 of them off of a 3 mile paved loop road. Along the trails you can see ancient trees and a variety of wildlife. At one point I ran in straight into a wild hog that is a descendant of the ones introduced into Florida by the Spanish explorers. I don't know who was more startled but he quickly ran off. My favorite hiking trail was the Cypress Swamp Trail that has a catwalk that gets you up close to the swamp. I wish I had planned for more time for the park but I tried to squeeze too much into one day. You can easily spend an entire day here. I can't wait to come back and next time it will be in the winter. After just a few of the trails I was drenched in sweat. This is a state park you don't want to miss.",Ariel W.,5 star rating,"Coconut Creek, FL","Fort Lauderdale, FL",Highlands Hammock State Park,yelp

There were large, numerous patches of seawood at times but it cleared out with the change of the tide.

If you plan to get back and forth more than once walking though, prepare for it to take a while! Theres a good Nature Center and gift shop with ice creams, drinks, rentals etc that adds some nice creature comforts to the experience. I enjoyed looking at all the guest book entries- people from all over the world had visited and commented, many who saw sharks and other sea water life. All enjoyed their visit. I brought my snorkels but didnt find it that worthwhile as there was hardly anything under the water really at all here. There is a cute rescue sea turtle in a float tank out in front of the gift shop/Nature center. I felt very sad for him as there was absolutely nothing in the tank at all.

It's cheap to get in. There's a car entrance fee for the park and the a separate fee to go to the fort itself. Only 2.50 a person.  My party tried to walk to the fort from the gate but it's about three miles to get there so a car is for sure recommended. BRING WATER! To start you enter this little museum with artifacts and a little movie showing. It's a tiny. From there you walk out and head towards the fort. There's a draw bridge that goes over what used to be a moat. I've never seen one so I was really excited. The only thing is basically a free for all. You can walk around for as long as you want you can go up stairs and through doors as long as they aren't blocked. Some of the rooms still have period stuff in them. I have no idea if it's really stuff or not but it was cool to visualize. I'm giving them a three only because there was no information. No signs or tours :( on certain days they have soldiers do reenactments. But when I come to places like this I want to know the history and the people you who were there.

6/26/2019,"How is it possible I haven't reviewed this State Park??? This park was our Boy Scout Troops favorite campout spot for years! I always ran this one- aquatics- we would swim, snorkel, tube, kayak, canoe and even scuba dive! I have been coming here for almost a decade- although it has been a few years since the last visit. This was my birthday gift to myself- I love camping and nature! Campsites are available for tent or RV- they have new bathrooms since the last time I camped here- and handicap accessible stalls and separate bathroom complete with shower. They also offer cabins- something I keep saying I want to do. The spring feeds into the St Johns River- but the swimming area is a stretch of river from the spring- down to the second dock. The closer you go upstream to the spring, the harder the current- stay off to the side for easier movement. If you snorkel- you will see numerous fish including alligator gar. We had a manatee swim right past us. Do NOT touch the manatees. Period. They are protected and the park takes this very seriously- the manatee that swam by us had a park escort. She kayaked just behind warning people to move and//or not touch. They have tube rentals, locker rentals, a gift shop, a cafe & for a small fee they will even inflate your tube!

6/27/2019,"Weeki Wachee Springs is a nice little park with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it's not quite there yet. It's undergone many improvement since the state took over and it's starting to return to its former glory. The mermaid shows are always fantastic and great for the kids; once the underwater theater is remodeled, they will be even better. Some of the improvements are more functional, like improvements to the foot paths around the park. The boat ride is always a blast and the boat crew gives a great tour - especially Richard! The wildlife show is nice, but it seems like there could be a few more attractions given all the acreage within the park limits. Buccaneer Bay is a nice swimming hole but gets way too crowded once the nice weather arrives. Kayaking and paddle boarding down the Weeki Wachee River, even though it's not affiliated with the park, is a great way to round out the day.

6/30/2019,"Another five star rating goes to this incredible state park located in beautiful Dunnellon, FL. We've been trying to book this park ever since we purchased our camper back in 2016. My wife was finally lucky enough to snag a spot when it suddenly became available. A bit of a drive for us in Orlando, but very much worth the 2 hour commute. The sites themselves are fantastic. Plenty of space between neighbors and plenty of woods between sites for great privacy. The sites are very large and this park is one of the only state parks I've been to that features full hookup sites. That's right...power, water AND sewer hookups on all of their sites!    There is private access to the springs, for campers only, but honestly the main springs attraction that is down the road a bit is MUCH better. We have been to A LOT of different springs around Central Florida, but Rainbow Springs is hands down the best we've experienced. The water is absolutely gorgeous. Because the water is not shallow enough for people to stand, the muck on the bottom doesn't get stirred up, thus giving you crystal clear springs. It's a very good idea to either bring your own floating devices or buy them from the on site store they have. There is also food concessions available that offer hamburgers, hotdogs, pizza and even taquitos. If you can tear yourself away from the springs for a bit, rent or bring your own kayak/canoe and paddle down through the river and enjoy tons of wildlife. You can even get out of your kayak and swim right on the river. It's amazing! There are also some man made ""attractions"" at the park that are very cool. There are several spring waterfalls that make for cool photo ops or are simply amazing to look at. Nature trails are sprinkled throughout the park, they off plenty of bike riding opportunities and/or rent an inner tube for a 2 hour ride down the river with shuttle service that brings you back to the campground. The campground bathroom and showering facilities are well maintained and very clean.The possibilities are near endless at this park and we can't wait to head back again. In fact, I'm pretty sure my wife has already booked a trip for next year already. This park is definitely in my top two for Florida State Parks. Check this place out if you haven't already.

They swam right through the area where many guests were swimming, so the manatee volunteer who was following them on kayak made sure everyone kept a respectful distance. I was so impressed with how much respect the park has for the wildlife. Beautiful, clean spring. We kayaked for almost an hour and It was the perfect amount of time for us.

We arrived at the visitor center (which had a huge parking lot) where you can take a boat ride or tram ride to the actual park. Of course, the boat ride is the way to go if you want to see natural beauty, but beware! The boat doesn't have any covering, so make sure you have sunscreen or a hat on and stay hydrated. Once we made it to the park we were super hot and sweaty, so it's mighty convenient that there's a cafe right when you enter the building. They had ice cream and burgers and hot dogs and other items. We didn't get anything, but we thought that it was great to have available. Admission to the park is $13 per adult. They stamp your hand and give you a little map, which isn't really necessary since it's a loop and signage is abundant. Anyhow, the enclosures looked clean and the animals appeared to be in excellent shape to my untrained eyes. I've never been so close to an alligator (see photo) - it was amazing! Some of the animals were chilling as best they could to keep cool in the summer heat, but most of them were quite active in the middle of the afternoon, which was nice to see.

7/3/2019,"This Florida state park is over 1,000 acres along the Intracoastal Waterway south of Stuart. It has four miles of hiking trails over several different natural communities including sand pine scrub, scrubby flat woods,a baygall and a mangrove swamp. The baygall community is one of the rarest in Florida. It is a swampy habitat containing loblolly bay and sweetbay which act as filters for the run off water from the scrubby flatwoods. This helps to keep clean the water flowing into the Indian River Lagoon. The north trail loop is 3.2 miles of sand trail that winds like a maze through the scrub. The south loop is 1.9 miles and parallels the intracoastal but you can't see it. Bikers can ride on the East Coast Greenway, a paved path running from the parking lot into Hobe Sound. The preserve offers protection to the threatened Florida Scrub Jays and gopher tortoises. There is a restroom and benches adjacent to the parking lot but there  is absolutely no shade for the trails. In 90 degree weather it was brutal. I walked a small portion of the north trail but it was difficult because it's soft sand. There was a evidence of a recent fire. There are so many nicer places to hike with shade and water views in this area.

(It's the same price for tandem kayaks & canoe rentals.)Just a $5 park entrance fee ($4 if you're solo), so no big complaints here. The area is overgrown in some locations, the mosquitoes were out in force, & we didn't see a lot of wildlife, w/ the exception of wonderful turtles & some large birds. It's a serene area & an easy waterway to navigate, just not as nice as other state parks in the area.

7/7/2019,"I've been to a lot of beaches in the area and by far this was one that presented the most hassle,Enter at the north end, and you can park for free, but it's $2 admission using the honor system. Although, swimming is not allowed in this section as it indicates the water currents are too rough. Enter at the main entrance and you have to pay $8 for your carload. The park ranger said this is the best beach around--I totally disagree for the following reasons:-first, its not free. You have to pay admission. It rained during our stay and we were only there two hours. Not worth it. -you have to walk a good distance to the beach from the parking lot, perhaps 15 minutes, it's a pain when you're carrying beach chairs, towels, umbrellas, cooler, etc....unless, you take the tram to the south beach. -the beach had seaweed and they obviously had no interest cleaning it up, even for Independence Day weekend. -the sand was light colored but hard-the water this weekend (July 2019) was not clear at all, very green, but other surrounding beaches were clearer. -no showers or change rooms right at the main beach, just sand dunes. (You must take the tram to south end for those things)-dangerous; no lifeguards and signs everywhere warning of alligators. The only reason I can see people coming here is that it's a big quiet beach. You can easily spread out and have privacy.

7/7/2019,"This is a rustic state park that has hiking trails and kayak rentals. While being right off US 19 it is kind of hidden. The entrance is right next to a red Lobster. When you enter the park, there is an honor box to pay your park entrance fee and use the tag to hang on your rear view mirror. Don't risk an $80 ticket! Pay the fee, it is nominal (a couple bucks.) When you enter the parking lot, there is a large, raised restroom tower that also has a ramp so it is accessible. A company that rents kayaks is near the restroom tower. Two of us rented our kayaks from the company, and it is a really good deal. One friend had her own, so she brought it. There are a couple different routes you can take, one out to the bay, one into the springs and another near the springs. We Were able to do all three within a two hour window. However, if you are not a strong kayaker you may not be able to do them all. Either way, the kayaking is pretty easy in this area, especially if you ask which way the tide is going so you can use it on your return (against the tide on the way out, with the tide on the way in.)The young people working the rentals were very helpful and nice.

We also saw sheep head, snook, pin fish, mangrove snapper, lots of crabs, and many other various sea creatures.My kids had to use the restroom and happy they were close to the pier.

She gave us a map and told us where we might like to ride our bikes. Recent rain caused a lingering mist over a field of yellow flowers. Beautiful! (Truly a missed photo op, but we had only begun to tour the park!)  We parked at the main boat basin and selected to ride the quick 4-mile round trip to the tower and swinging bridge as more summer rains were a threat! What a nice family adventure on paved roads - slow and minimal traffic! We enjoyed the walking trail and informative nature signs as we headed to the swinging bridge and lookout tower! Crossing a canopy of trees, the bridge led to a thriller 75-foot tall tower, a safe but scary climb. Looking over the park and into the clouds is breathtaking, another great photo op!  Back at the basin, we ate lunch at the outpost. Service was friendly, affordable, quick, and delicious! We had bean soup, homemade potato chips, and brats. Yummy! This is a trip we will do again!

The beach was beautiful, water was warm and not crowded at all. They have firewood and ice for sale, however, be sure to ask if they have a ""burn ban"" in place prior to booking. The few weeks prior they did not allow fires at the campsites. Also, bring the bug spay! The noseeums or no see ums (gnats that bite) were no joke.

7/15/2019,"This is a must see for visitors here at the Keys! This historical landmark was named in honor of our 12th president Zachary Taylor. This park provides trails for many nature seekers, tours for history/educational loving visitors, and a beautiful beach for waterbabies and sunbathers. It is an amazing site to see the fortress that had been used during Civil War era. The fort used to protect invaders is a site not just of monumental history, but it is a place home to many wild life. There was a serious amount of iguanas we were seeing throughout our walk. The noise of wrestling leaves and movement we heard can make anyone nervous. This was specially built and aided in many wars like this the Spanish American war especially for the naval fleet.To visit this state park there is a price to enter per person and a price for each vehicle that enters in. But it is well worth it for those looking for a beach on Key West. The beach is beautiful and filled with loads of floating seaweed. The water is nice and warm and it was the nicest beach we've seen this far aside from the beach on NAS Key West. It was definitely better than Smathers Beach.. wish smelled horrendously and the small beach on the base isn't publicly available for non military members. The public restrooms and showers are very clean! It's a plus for me!The beach is relaxing and it wasn't overly packed during our visit. I enjoyed the serene beach and even caught some turtle nesting preservation sites.  We took a lot of family photos and viewed sites like the Blacksmith's site, the Fort, and other various locations throughout the park where they had historical signs of nature's wildlife. We captured viewing several birds, creepy crawlers, iguanas, lizards and tropical plants. It is one of the top places we've been to on the island of Key West. Just load up on bug spray before coming.

7/15/2019,"My review is for Weeki Wachee Springs Park/Buccaneer Bay only - not the river kayak.  I have mixed feelings about my experience here.  I brought my husband, nephew and mom for a day of relaxing by the water.  I realized with it being summer time, it'd be packed with families so it was no surprise when we were met with a crowd on a Wednesday.  Thankfully we got there early enough before they send out the dreaded text message to everyone waiting in line saying they will have to try again tomorrow.  When they fill up, they turn people away.  GET THERE EARLY AND SIGN UP TO GET AUTOMATED TEXT MESSAGES.  I absolutely loved the mermaid show.  Even my 16 year old nephew loved it.  I was super impressed that these ladies can be under water for so long with nothing but a small nozzle and line to breath from while lip syncing to a track.  The water slides were the best part - the lines weren't too long and plopping into a freezing cold spring definitely perked us up a bit.  I liked that they had ample beach chairs to claim and spots up on a small hill with shaded picnic tables to hide from the sun.  They also offer rentals - lockers, beach chairs, half shell tent canopies etc.  Do yourself a favor and rent a locker.  Being the overly trusting person that I am, I left our GoPro in our cooler bag and it got jacked.  Of course, it's my own fault, but do not trust any of those innocent looking families for a second!   Another bummer was the ""lazy river"" which they make you pay $7 more for.  You literally float around the perimeter of the main pool area which is all of 5-6 minutes and you need to paddle.  You don't get to see any of the river or flip out of the tube for a swim.  Lifeguards are blowing whistles nonstop so try to sit far enough away from them or you'll have ringing in your ears the rest of the day.  Another issue was the closures of many of the natural exhibits in the park because they are under renovation.  This is not disclosed when you enter the park.  Do not waste your time walking all the way over there because you'll have to turn around and walk back.  We asked a bartender when they expected it to be done and she had no idea.  I heard the kayak experience is one of the best of all the springs so I would come back to do this but would skip the park unless you are OK with everything I mentioned above.  Make sure to book a kayak online well in advance - they do not accept walk ins.",Elizabeth R.,3 star rating,"Miami Beach, FL","Oviedo, FL",Weeki Wachee Springs,yelp

Each mile is well marked via Mile Markers. Paths are nice, wide and clean. All in all, while I enjoyed road biking for the first time, but being an avid mountain biker, my heart still belongs to the woods and trails.

Since I was a single driver, it was only $4 for me to enter with my car. There's not much road to this park, so know that you'll only encounter one large parking lot. From there, you can engage in various activities namely kayaking and paddle boarding. Rentals for either are located on your right-hand side as you're driving into the parking lot area. The person hosting the class took care of all the rentals for us, so I'm not sure what the process is. It's convenient though since the launch point is located rather close to the parking lot. The river through the mangroves is such a serene and relaxing atmosphere! Unfortunately, I just came from the virtually bug-less Everglades, so in my mind, there wouldn't be any mosquitoes. WRONG!

7/20/2019,"Throughout the United States, there are numerous forts that have significant historic value... and in Florida alone we have many; such as Fort Zachary Taylor in Key West, Castillo de San Marcos in St Augustine and Fort Jefferson on Gardens Key (Dry Tortuga).One of the coolest and most interesting forts/parks that I have ""never heard of"" is here on Fernandina Beach on Amelia Island (just north of Jacksonville). Over a thousand acres of pristine nature that just happens to include a Civil War era fort. The drive through the park is just gorgeous with tons of hanging most and plenty of shade trees creating a canopy over the roadway through the park. Along the sides of the roadway (Fort Clinch Road) there are numerous trails that can be seen that we saw plenty of hikers and some mountain bikes too. While driving Fort Clinch Road to the fort, we stopped at a couple points of interest.... we took in a quick view of the amazing beach and dunes (parking lot with boardwalks to the beach area) and we also stopped at a view point called Egan Creek Overlook. Seeing the Amelia Island Lighthouse, salt marshes and the creek were all just stunning. And then there is the actual fort... mind blowing... red brick fortress with so much to see from ammunitions storage, prisoner areas, cannons inside the walls and along the top too, soldier quarters, blacksmith shops, latrines, kitchens and all directly on a sandy beach and bordered with trees. I love that the fort trusts guests to walk anywhere and everywhere... see what you want and your own pace and there was plenty of personnel around if you had a question or wanted to learn a little history. After taking time to see the fort, the museum is free to tour. The museum has a great collection of Civil War tools and ammunitions, medical tools (for amputations during wartime), interesting photographs and plenty of knowledge.

They allow you to bring in coolers and your own equipment like tubes and snorkels which I highly recommend bringing so you can see all the wonders under the water! On our way to the springs I was telling a story to my best friends daughters! Who we happened to take with us! I told them last time I was here I swam with a manatee and didn't even know it till it was in my face! Scary but beautiful creatures! Welp as we're going down the river for the first time that day this man passes me on a kayak, I was stunned because kayaks are not allowed up to this point but when I saw his vest it read manatee something so that's when I figured out that a manatee had just swam past us! That's right! I've swam with manatees twice!!! This time the manatee swam up and down a little and then right between my bf and I! Again I was lucky enough to have a snorkeling mask and got to see how close this manatee had gotten to me as well! This is a great place to go and relax and feel at one with nature!

7/28/2019,"This state park came highly recommended during our FIRST week of camping in a brand new fifth wheel.  First,  the ranger was very curt with my husband and told him she assigned us a space rather than let us look around and find one we were comfortable with backing into. I told her prior to,  that we were rookies and had only been in pull thru sites this far.  The roads in the campground are very narrow with many trees and one had now left a permanent reminder on our camper.  Very narrow roads.  Not good for tall 5th wheels.  She could have advised me of that when I called.  Bathrooms were not clean.  NOT modern at all.  Never saw any one working there like we did in the other state parks.  No laundry facilities. Only recycling for cans,  not plastic,  glass,  etc.....No grass at campsite,  just mud. Lots of mud.  On the upside,  some beautiful deer joined us for coffee!! And the trail walk along the Santa Fe river was beautiful.  The exhibit about the CCC was very informative.   We won't be going back.

Asked the employee why I didn't receive a text and showed him my phone and he simply just showed me his phone showing his text message that he received. Again I showed him my phone with no text alert and he rolled his eyes telling me there's nothing he can do.

7/31/2019,"We visited Faver Dykes State Park campground recently (end of July) and were very disappointed with the experience. The 1.6 miles entrance dirt/sand road was pure torture, full of pot holes, which made our camper and truck filthy dirty and even caused the breakage of dinnerware inside the trailer.  We also had a trailer tire failure on the way back home of  a relatively new tire which I suspect may have been caused by all those pot holes causing tread separation.  Most of the camp sites were of plain sand which did not contribute to keeping the camper clean.  The tick infestation was also a nuisance, I found two on me despite avoiding all nature trails.  The bathroom and shower facilities were small, hot, and not kept in clean condition.  This is specially bad since one is forced to using them because the campground lacks sewer system (it does have a dump station but its use is only practical when leaving the park).In short we did not enjoy this visit and it will be our last.  we feel that if this park   cannot be made more suitable for humans it should be closed  down and make it an animal preserve strictly reserved for those species and save the Florida tax payers a little money.",H S.,1 star rating,"Wake Forest, NC","Saint Petersburg, FL",Faver-Dykes State Park,yelp

We went on a Friday so we could do the extended glass bottom boat tour (the extended ones are only offered on Friday's and Saturdays) and it was so amazing! We saw a ton of wildlife (monkeys, gators, turtles, manatees, fish, birds) and the boat itself is so unique with the glass bottom. It was unbelievable how clear the water was and how much stuff you could see! Our tour guide, Kevin, was fantastic - he told us a lot of the history of the place and some fun facts/jokes. The park itself is also super nice! There are places to eat, walking trails, kayaking - a lot you can do! We didn't kayak this time, but it would definitely be a fun adventure with all of the animals & crystal clear water. The boat tour is worth it for your first time I think so that you can hear all the history and see all the wildlife easily. You can't beat the price either - at $25 per adult for an 1.5 hour extended tour, it's worth it!

It is the effect of water running into a very large, deep sinkhole. The size of the waterfall can vary pretty significantly with the flow of the water.   The streams of water were really small on the day of our visit. If you have the flexibility, go after a rainy period and the waterfall will be more impressive.  The park has walking trails throughout. The park has nice picnic areas that are clean. There is a playground near the large picnic area.  There is also a lake with a designated swimming section.

The drive in under the historical canopy was so beautiful. The entire park is so well maintained. It is a wonderful place. We lucked out and got to tour the fort on the first Saturday of the month which was a union re-enactment. So glad we waited! Loved having the mostly volunteer crew there to answer questions. The two historical park rangers run the events and I can't recommend it enough. It adds so much to the experience. Be prepared with the 2.50 per person in cash as they apparel often have problems with charge cards. We took the kayak tour with rangers John and Zack. Even though it rained most of the trip it was wonderful. They were very informative and helpful. We got to learn more about the history and wildlife while kayaking on the creek. We saw tons of different birds and paddled through the marsh. A highlight of our trip!We searched for sharks teeth on the beach by the fort, my son found a few small ones..

One lifeguard at the water slide remarked, ""Oh look, another field trip group, I bet they all drown."" When we returned our umbrella, the attendant working the desk remarked, ""I don't need that umbrella on the counter,"" and just stared at my husband until he removed it. I would have given 5 stars if the customer service was better and if I saw an employee walking around picking up trash. Would we return? Yes.

Restrooms need a/c but they were in good shape. Trails were flooded so couldn't really use them. Folks were very nice. A Ranger helped trim trees so camper could fit.  It was just a fair stay.

8/8/2019,"Went with our 6yo and 3yo girls. It was a blast. Was our favorite of the 4 Springs we visited. The other 3 were Alexander, Rainbow, and Silver. The girls enjoyed the mermaid shows. We watched both of them. Make sure you arrive to the park before they open on the weekends, when they get full they don't let anyone else in. Cost was $13 per adult. 5 and under free. We went on a Wednesday to make sure there was less of a crowd. Arrived at 930am and by noon the place was packed. You can bring a cooler with food and beverages which is what we did. They have a restaurant and bar that sells alcoholic beverages as well as a gift shop if you want to spend some money. There's 3 different slides and a huge swim area in the springs. You have to be 42"" to go down one of them not sure of the others. Water is at a constant 72 degrees very nice on a hot day. There's a floating jumping dock they have over the deep end which is about 20ft deep. You can see straight down to the bottom. There's stairs to get on the dock but you have to swim out to the deep end to get on. Kids can get on as well. Our kids were jumping off, they had on floaties. There's stairs to get in springs and a big shallow end which is about 2-3ft.  There's also a separate kiddie pool which was nice for our kids to play in with a small slide and a seating area, it's fenced off which is nice as well. Along the spring there are lawn chairs and beach sand first come first serve seating. There's also a 30 min river cruise on a boat max capacity 30 which fills up quickly. So head over there as soon as they open to book your reservation. Fills up super quick. Overall it was an excellent experience. We all enjoyed very much.

8/11/2019,"Wow. Some people really expect a lot for $1. That's what it cost us to enter. $6 per vehicle, and we had 6 in the vehicle. Apparently there is a big to-do because when the state took over, they took out the diving platform. The Audacity! Of making it safer for all, and making SEEING the actual spring priority over a diving platform you could experience at any public pool. (The diving platform was over the deepest part, which is the spring itself, making snorkeling over the spring impossible with people jumping off the platform onto your head.)Love the convience store. Not only do they sell soda and snacks and hot dogs, but they rent tubes, life vests and such to bring your Blue Springs enjoyment to the next level. It's just a swimming hole, but still well worth $6 per vehicle. In fact, I think they should increase the admission fee to help fund sprucing up the boardwalk. I don't think they should reinstall the diving platform. I have not stayed at the campground, but could see how my rating might be less if I did. No privacy from day parking area. The water is cold, like all the springs in the area. But the water is truly blue and beautiful. Very happy there is no drinking, like at Ginny Springs.

This park is located about 10 minutes away from a bustling community college , you would never guess it though. It's hidden on the left side of the road. As soon as we drove through we were engulfed by REAL Florida scenery , native fauna and flora . My friend Sam had a paddle board and kayak already which saved us some cash, but they have kayak rentals starting at $18 an hour then $4 per 15 minutes .. not too bad in comparison to some parks ( which we're charging $50 from the get go). The park offered some pretty scenic trails, picnic tables , a little museum and a weigh station . The gift shop , which was also the kayak rental shop , they had a baby sea turtle in a tank outside the shop, which was fun for the kiddos to see, the attendant at the shop was very knowledgeable and kept us in the loop about the weather and upcoming storms; what time to return etc. The bathrooms could've been a little cleaner for my liking, but you get what you get when you're at a state park, right?  They offered a complimentary trolley service to and from the park to the beach (operation times were 10am-4pm).We ended up kayaking and paddle boarding with the kids for about 1.5 hours, swam and came back to continue to the beach for the rest of our duration. 2 parks for $5 .

8/11/2019,"TERRIBLLEEEEEE!!! Their staff is blatantly offensive. I wish I would have gotten names because these girls definitely need to be blasted. Customer service is not the job for you! And I'm speaking to any female staff member that works in that hot box you call an office or check in or whatever you want to call it. There was one blonde and one brunette mainly. When I took a look at all the bad reviews they ALL say that THE STAFF IS RUDE. This is true! 100%. No type of accommodation or recommendation or anything, just a big fat NO. I traveled 3 hours with 3 of my friends and our children & rented a house for the whole weekend, just to be turned around. The Weeki Wachee Springs website is not user friendly. It just sells all the attractions and doesn't forewarn you to make any type of reservations by any means. When we got there they were basically like, ""Where's your reservation?"" and when we didn't have one they were basically like, ""Ok, bye!"" It was my first time here but my friends have been before. My friend told me that any other time they came they just arrived, rented the kayaks, and enjoyed their day. Well apparently since November 2018 you now have to have a reservation. When I made the comment that it should at least say that on the website since it does not, one of the blonde haired girls said it a very snotty way that it was right on the front page of the website basically rolling her eyes, which it indeed, is not. My friend even asked to speak to a manager, which I wasn't present for the conversation but my friend let us know they basically just weren't trying to help at all. All the negative reviews all state the same thing about the rudeness and the inefficient system of the park. DEAR OWNERS/PRESEDENT/PERSON IN CHARGE: you guys are clearly doing something WRONG. Creating more negative experiences than positive. Thank goodness our trip was still saved by THE KAYAK SHACK, whom we reached out to after our terrible experience at Weeki Wachee State Park, who was more than willing to accommodate us and make sure we had a fantastic experience.

When I arrived to the boardwalk, which you can take the beautiful 6-7 minute walk yourself or take one of the ongoing golf carts that transport people until 4pm most days, I was greeted by a large green iguana and walking onto the sand I could see medium-sized crabs that blended in with the sand poking their heads out of the holes they made to see if the coast was clear. It costs $4 for entry if you're alone in a car, or $5 if you have 2+ people.

Granted the water is not quite as nice (browner/murkier) since you are closer to the inlet (think Flagler beach) but it is still a lovely beach to visit. They are not giving it away, but the food/drink shack is a great retreat when you have had enough sun to nurse a cold one and grab a bite. I had a Landshark and a grilled fish sandwich, apple slices were a nice touch, hit the spot; and the view can not be beat. If you are physically challenged, know that there is a decent walk to the shore from the parking lot, but they do have a lovely walk way to get you there, there are stairs involved at the end, but the view is lovely. $8 bucks will get you in the park.",michael w.,4 star rating,"Northbrook, IL","Sarasota, FL",Anastasia State Park,yelp

Entry into the park is pretty cheap so we pay to get in in the front entrance worker was ridiculously friendly explaining what they have and where everything is located and what time certain things were open until. There are many signs to show you exactly where everything is located so it is very easy Define everything. The history behind the park is wonderful because they tell you how and why people settled there. There are different buildings that you can go into and see how the group lived when they first settled down there. The scenery around the park is gorgeous and there are many different animals just roaming around. One really cool thing about this part is that you can camp there and if I was in the mood and could talk everyone into it we definitely would have.

8/17/2019,"$6 for a car load! You can't beat the price to enter the park. Even if you stay for a short time and there is only 1 or 2 of you, you'll have an enjoyable experience. The water is cold! 72° year round. There is a cove on the deep end where some catfish hide away from the crowds. There are bathrooms nearby, a place for food and drink, and a gift shop that does rentals. Canoe & Kayak rentals available. (2person size) $25 for 2 hours, $5 for an additional hour, then it's less than $0.50 (I think it was $.013) for every hour after that. If you're not back by closing(the we sure said 6pm but when we got there the sign said 8pm), it's $1 per MINUTE after closing. Be sure to verify the time the rentals close!!! We were fine, the weather decided to interrupt us so we brought the canoe back early due to the lightening. There are no refunds for any reason. I do recommend renting! We saw many gators, babies and adults. One swam near us that was around 6'. Be sure to wear bug spray! I missed spraying my left foot and got ate up only in that area. There is a camping area and plenty of campsites and grills that are spread out. Large groups still had enough space to keep distance between areas so it didn't feel crowded. They only allow so many vehicles, so come early to get in, so we are told. We went late in the day but it was midweek and there were around 50 parking spaces still available. BYOKayak, BYOCanoe, BYOPaddle Board! I saw several with their own gear. Some had inflatable paddle boards, inflatable kayaks, and I spoke with 4 of them and they had no issues going down and back up the river. There is no fee for using your own stuff, but there could be a fee (check because I don't know) for a trailer if you require one to bring in your aquatic gear.

One wonderful aspect was the park Ranger .. we had run over our time and the park was scheduled to close.  The Ranger told us not to hurry ... that it was our day. He was wonderful.  We of course did hurry - but we were so thankful for his understanding and kindness. If you go to this beach or most any of the Florid beaches after a rain shower be aware of the noseeums...they sting and there are a lot of them.

Having a seat on the benches located throughout the garden offer a nice and quiet time to reflect and enjoy the climate we often take for granted. Of course the summer months are much less attractive than our pseudo winter months but the park is so pristinely maintained that bugs aren't a dire issue here in any way regardless of the climate.

9/15/2019,I found this famous Sink Hole based on a recommendation from a friend who once lived here in Gainesville. The park was easy to find and cost just $4 per car to park your vehicle. I visited the attraction on a Saturday morning just after it opened up at 9am. There are signs leading you to the pathway to the stairs that lead you to the observation platform. Be prepared to get your Fitbit steps in! As I stood on the platform I honestly felt a spiritual experience while admiring this ecological wonder. Afterward you can walk the trail around the perimeter of the sink hole which is approximately 0.6 miles.

Entrance fee Varys but they are flexible with you entering and leaving as much as you please as long as they are open. So you can go have lunch and come back or do what you please. The beach it's self is bit harsh with a lot of rocks so just bring water shoes. This is also a good place to snorkel. You could have a beautiful picnic by the beach or a BBQ.

9/22/2019,"4 Stars for gorgeous springs with spots for grilling.We parked and got ourselves ready for a day of grilling and swimming in the spring. When you walk from the entrance (where you pay) down the stairs you'll be struck by the impressive landscape that meets you. It's a gorgeous lookout and is at an elevation that really highlights the main attraction. We got set up by the gazebos in a little grilling spot (we hadn't reserved a gazebo and a Boy Scouts troop had taken over the one closest to us). It was a bit of a bummer how far the grilling/gazebo area was from the spring itself (you can't even see the spring from there), but it allows for a wide-open field for people to pitch tailgating tents and lay out in the sun. Still- it made me miss Wekiva Springs where there is abundant space around the spring so everyone has a lovely view.The spring is tucked away a bit and has an area roped off for swimming. I'm not mad about the ropes and the sense of (false?) safety they give me that I won't have a run-in with a gator! The water is wonderfully chilly as you'd expect and quite deep, so don't expect to do any standing while in the water. We got a legit workout trying to stay afloat. I understand why they don't allow anyone to bring in floats, because I imagine the space can become very limited if everyone has a large inflatable pizza slice with them, but the pool noodles are only available in the gift shop and it was cash only. We had enough cash to buy four $3 noodles, but as a group of 7, we would've bought a lot more if they took card (especially since an adult needs two of these thin noodles to stay above water). I'm ashamed to admit that our early millennial, mid/late 30 bodies couldn't tread water for more than ten minutes at a time... So we definitely would've been able to enjoy our time in the water a lot longer with more floatation devices. It was also kind of strange that they didn't take card in the shop as it's connected to the front window where we paid our entrance fee with a credit card... Hopefully they start accepting card in the shop as well.Overall, the park was beautiful, the spring was chilly and refreshing, and it wasn't too packed on a beautiful weekend day. I'd definitely return, but maybe try to smuggle in a few pool noodles of my own.",Andi P.,4 star rating,"Orlando, FL","Savannah, GA",Rainbow Springs State Park,yelp

9/25/2019,"Decided to venture out to an area park today with my adult daughter and this place did not dissapoint. My navigation tried to have us go to one of the hotels but there were signs for the park. Entrance is only $8 per vehicle and well worth it for the views alone. We opted for lunch at the Lighthouse cafe. It has patio dining with a view of the lighthouse and a glimpse of the ocean. There is ample wildlife around from pigeons and squirrels to iguanas amd tame raccoons.  There are signs to not feed them but I met a regular patron who tends to break the rules and got some cute photos. She had a grilled chicken sandwich and rice and I ordered the steak sandwich and fries. Both lunches with water to drink came to $20 plus tip. Both of our meats were tender and the sandwiches come with lettuce, tomato and onion but they ask if you want them and offer other condiments.  The fries were crisp and not greasy at all. Serving size is good and definitely would eat there again. It's located right by a beach access with handicapped accessible beach and restrooms all right there. It seems to be a favorite beach spot and I know it's packed on weekends. Parking was great and there was a bike rental booth and an ice cream truck in addition to the cafe. The center piece of the park is a beautiful lighthouse. You can climb to the top but I'm  a scaredy cat when it comes to heights.  They do offer guided tours and there are lots of informational plaques and displays with trails to walk.  Also there are many benches to sit and enjoy the surroundings.  I know we didnt cover nearly everything in a quick afternoon!",Miriam A.,5 star rating,"Biloxi, MS","Boston, MA",Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park,yelp

9/25/2019,This place is a must see If you are in central florida.   My daughter and I kayaked the 6 mile trip from the head spring to the take out point at Roger's park.   The water is crystal clear and 72 degrees all year.  We even swam with a manatee!  The kayaking is downstream so it's easy.   You can almost just float the whole way.   Takes 4 hours to paddle the entire 6 miles including stopping to swim.  Make sure you arrive early.   And it can get super crowded in the summer and they limit the amount of people.  So sign up online well before you go.

I've been here a few times now and it pays to drive slow. While doing so and constantly looking left and right I've spotted deer to the side of the road and red tailed hawk, among other wildlife. You can stop at your leisure and take pics like I did. Take a look at their web site for more info/details. BTW, there are a number of people that think that because they paid a ""WHOPPING $6"" to get in they're entitled to better park standards.

You have to drive about 20 minutes to get to the next park that has a dump station but it wasn't a big deal. The  campground is so close to the spring, similar to Otter Springs, which is awesome when you have kids.

The park also has a short boat ride down the river that leaves frequently so you can see natural Florida and it seems to be in great condition! Lots of fish and vegetation easily visible in the crystal clear water (I would know I work in natural resources). They offer kayaking also, but it gets booked quickly so you'll have to call and make reservations a few days in advance at least. The swimming area is located by the spring and is large. There's a beachy area they made adjacent where you can grab lounge chair. The water is always 74 from the spring so come in the winter too! They've got a bar right there too and places to grab some food. The only things I didn't like is you can't swim in the spring, even when the mermaid show isn't going on and we were there on a Sunday afternoon and the bar was closed.

It was freezing for the whole 2 hours I was in the water but the scenery was so beautiful I didn't mind at all (ok maybe a little). If you get too cold and think it's time to head out of the water, make sure you bring a blanket or a towel so you can lay out on the grass and enjoy the view. They also have little outdoor grills and seating so you can have a whole barbecue and picnic with your family and friends.

10/14/2019,"I would love to give this park a 5 star rating because it is really beautiful. However nothing can ruin a camping trip worse than bugs. Although there was a nice breeze the No seeums would not let up, they were literally at our site all day and all night. I am back home now (a day early due to the bugs) and want to warn people. No bug repellent of any kind works, wearing long sleeve clothing does help but because we are in Florida not everyone in our party even brought long sleeves. Another one of our friends actually packed up their camper after the first night and left.    Also after reading another review I also was charged $8 to enter and did not know I shouldn't have because we came and stayed with family in their campsite. Possibly in the freezing winter the bugs would be better? But that is rare in Florida too.",Adele W.,3 star rating,"Miami, FL","Canton, MI",Sebastian Inlet State Park,yelp
10/16/2019,"Caladesi Island was a spontaneous and last minute thought for us on a four day trip, but I am SO glad we chose something outdoorsy for the last day. We drove to Honeymoon Island, checked out the area but it was a bit crowded. We then bought ferry tickets and took the ferry to Caladesi. The ferry crew were so welcoming and friendly, they felt like family! Caladesi itself is absolutely amazing. It is an ""untouched"" island where you're bound to see some wildlife! We saw a beautiful tortoise as soon as we got on land! We visited the shop, walked along the beach, and then headed for the kayak rentals. I HIGHLY recommend to EVERYONE that you should kayak the mangroves of Caladesi if you're in the tampa area and have a day to spare. The experience was like no other! I took a first time kayaker with me and he loved it! There is a 3 hour option and a 1 hour option. Either will have breathtaking views and probably manatees!

10/16/2019,"I had waited over a year to visit this park due to Hurricane Michael tearing up this area last year. A lot of their trees are down and you can still see damage in the area and they are rebuilding and renovating the park areas. The history here is so amazing and I didn't realize until the tour. Bring your own flashlight if you can! They do have them here, but I just liked mine a bit better to see into dark corners! Everyone we spoke to was nice. Our tour guide was an older gentleman who was really nice and knew the history well. He answered all of our random questions and pointed out bats along the way! I would definitely come visit. It's only about an hour from Tallahassee so I good little weekend trip. Remember that they are on Central time though so you can leave Tallahassee at 8 then get there at 8. I recommend this Park and I can't wait until it fully reopens. The gift shop and little museum are also really cool.

The show was great until the mermaids TOOK OFF their tails. This of course lead my 6 year old to ask how they could do that if they were real mermaids. And she seemed to be disappointed after that. It kinda ruined the magic of it all. We were disappointed too that the river boat tour ended so early in the day. The last boat left in the middle of the mermaid show.

Otherwise, make sure to check out the adjoining mountain bike trails if you can! The Munson Trails are just a lot of fun without a whole lot of challenge.

I went here to explore the hiking trails to take photos of the bamboo forests. There are 3 trails of varying lengths that run off each other so you can go for a short walk or link them together to take a much longer hike surrounding the entire state park. That was quite enjoyable on its own, then there's also the historic settlement on the grounds that you can explore. It's got quite a story and between the trails and the settlement there was plenty of natural shade to make it enjoyable even on the hot sunny day that I was there. Plenty of restrooms, play area for kids, a boat ramp and even a campground. Set aside a few hours to really take in all that this park has to offer and bring a picnic. Perfect place.

10/29/2019,"This review is for the kayak/paddle-boarding rental facility within Weeki Wachee State Park.  This is not in the water park area!  As you pull into the parking lot for the water park, go all the way to the back.  There you will see the signs for Weeki Fresh Water Adventures.  Follow the back road in, and go all the way back.  There will be gravel, and some days it will be a little muddy, so don't wear your favorite shoes!I've been to this state park kayaking several times over the course of the last 4 years.  It by far is a ""must do, and must see"" on my ""if you come to Florida"" list!  This last weekend my brother was visiting and I just had to bring him to this spot.The people inside the rental facility are always super nice and willing to answer any questions you may have.  One thing I have learned, is that in order to secure a reservation, make them online first!  I have been standing in line several times watching people and families get turned away because they were full.  So make the online reservation, pay in advance and it will be smooth sailing.They help with everything, they will get you in the water, push you off the ramp and wave with a smile.  The water is gorgeous and you are going with the river flow for most of the trip.  This means that even the most inexperienced kayaker can participate in this activity.  It's about a 6 mile ride.  Which sounds long at first, but is easily done in 2-3 hours.  This year they did cap the amount on the water to 4 hours. So if you stay past that, you will have additional charges.In addition, they only allow reusable water bottles on the river (don't bring a plastic bottle you will have to throw it out) and their rule of no-alcohol is strictly enforced. Feel free to bring snacks, sunscreen and there are sandy places along the river to stretch your legs, swim/snorkel, pull over and picnic, and sometimes you'll even get to see a few manatees swim by.The water is clear and perfect.  The first few miles of the river you can easily imagine yourself in a prehistoric place, where you can see down 30 feet into the water, and the vines of trees hang down.  It is absolutely gorgeous.  The water is refreshing, and doesn't go over 78 degrees.I have rented, and self launched here.  I have to say that for only about $40.00 for a kayak or paddle board rental, it's way easier than bringing your own..unless you have a large family.  They do charge for self launch but it doesn't include a bus ticket back to your car.  You see, the tour ends at Rogers Park, which is down the river a ways.  So, if you do end up self-launching you either have to buy a bus ticket back, have a car parked there, or wait for a friend to take the bus back to Weeki Wachee to come get you.The trip is self-guided, you won't get lost, and it is what you make it to be.  Sit back, and enjoy the beauty that Florida has to offer.",Krissie C.,4 star rating,"Tampa, FL","Windermere, FL",Weeki Wachee Springs,yelp

My wife asked why no ranger came at that time to verify the complaint and he had no response.  Then he stated that someone claimed we were cutting down trees for firewood, Well we have Oak cut by a chainsaw (that is in the back of both pickups that he refused to acknowledge) in a Pine tree Area, I told him the chopping noise was us using a machete to trim OUR longer branches, when I challenged him on that he looked at our pit and says ""I see our wood in your pit"" really?? then told us to pack up, it was 10;00 am and check out is 1:00 pm, I had a total knee replacement 2 months ago and slow moving in the morning .

11/7/2019,"My father contracted Vibrio Vulnificus bacteria in the water at Rocky Bayou on 7/5/19 and DIED from it two days later 7/7/19. The water at Rocky Bayou is brackish. It is the back of the bay where fresh water comes in and makes it the perfect breeding ground in warm weather for this bacteria also known as flesh eating bacteria. The park itself is wonderful and naturally occurring bacteria is not the fault of the park but since it is not part of the bacteria testing you do see posted there, there should be a sign near the swimming area warning that you should not swim with an open wound or a compromised immune system because the probability of contracting the bacteria is high for those individuals. DO NOT SWIM IN THIS WATER IN THE SUMMER WITH AN OPEN WOUND AND ABSOLUTELY NOT IF YOU ARE IMMUNE COMPROMISED.

There is plenty of room to relax on land when you bring your whole family and it's an awesome picnic area.

The park is on the smaller side compared to many other state parks. There was what appeared to be a small walking trail in a wooded area, but it was short and didn't really go anywhere; it just led over to an area for official vehicles to park. There's one pier that gives a nice view of the salt marshes. The best feature is a longer boardwalk that goes over the marshes and leads out to a wide, scenic view and has some information about the salt marshes and animal and plant life found in the area.

This is only my opinion on the portion of the park that I was able to experience. The grounds were well kept and the park was exactly as described. The beaches were magnificent!

If you have kids with you, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you ask about doing the Junior Ranger booklet to get your pin and sticker. It is a few activity book where the answers are based on what the kids see and do. Just remember to BRING YOUR OWN PENS!My kids loved seeing manatees up close as well as the hippo. Super cool.

12/1/2019,"The fun of nature's amusement park of yore has been replaced with a nature park that has no animals, minimal wildlife that is in the form of birds and turtles, and a walking trail with multiple paths that lead to nowhere. I guess it's not fair to compare this park to what I remember as a kid, but I can't help it because the shell of all that has survived is a constant reminder. There appears to be one shop, one restaurant and one ice cream parlor. The rest of the vacant spaces look like junk storage areas. I saw a couple who looked to be planning a wedding, meeting with a representative over the various options. I heard the word ""ballroom"" so I perked up thinking perhaps I missed something. Then I saw the word ""ballroom"" over the door of a big dusty, dirty room with round tables that is on the strip where shops and restaurants once were.  The glass bottom boat tour was ok, but I think it's tacky to ask for tips. I also never saw the ""silver spring"" that the park is named for. I remember on tours back in the day, the captain would position the boat over a spring where the bottom sediment shined and spurted silver looking bits of whatever it is down there. Maybe if you want to canoe or kayak you'd have a better experience. I guess I was expecting too much for $2 and free parking. I'd pay more to be able to do and see more.

Touring it was a nice respite out of the sun and heat. I didn't bring an umbrella, so I used the natural mangroves to provide some relief. Worked out great. I sat my stuff on one of the picnic tables, laid claim, and headed for the water. The water was nice, but had quite a bit of seaweed in it. I don't know of that's normal, or was due to the storm heading straight for the Keys. I dealt with it, but hope it's not always like that. The price to get in was fine. I was more than willing to pay it, since the beach across from the B&B where I was staying was no bigger than my postage stamp backyard.

12/14/2019,"Lover's Key State Park was the PERFECT venue for our beach fairytale wedding! When we were venue shopping we were looking for a beach venue where we could have our ceremony, cocktail hour and reception in the sand. This was harder to find than you may think as most venues just have the ceremony in the sand and the remainder of your event in a ballroom. Luckily, my parents saw Lover's Key as an option and it sounded perfect!From our first visit to Lover's Key, we were in LOVE! Lover's Key State Park is like no other venue! And it was everything we were looking for - a dreamy, private beach venue that we could make our own. A venue where no wedding is the same. A place we could have our ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner and dancing all on the sand under the Florida sky. We especially loved riding on the tram through the beautiful nature park that led to the beach where there was a huge gazebo right on the sand, perfect for dancing!From the initial visit, Amanda Reynolds was so helpful in providing us with all the information we would need to make a well informed decision - from recommended vendors, venue layouts, rental pricing, and sample invoices, she had it all ready for us! Amanda was truly phenomenal! She is so sweet and we quickly realized having her to organize and coordinate our wedding was INVALUABLE! She became my right-hand throughout the wedding planning process - working hand-in-hand with myself, our caterer and DJ to create a realistic timeline of events and venue layout. There were a few rental items I fell in love with and Amanda worked hard to secure them for our wedding - namely our white chiavari chairs and our beautiful four-post arch. She was so patient and accommodating and was a the key to making our wedding day run so smoothly. She guided us through our rehearsal and was there the day of to direct my wedding party down the aisle as well as coordinate all the vendors and ensure everything was set up in the correct place the day of the wedding. She even offered to set up our personal decorations on the day of the wedding. When our wedding day came, it was truly MAGICAL! Everything at the venue looked more beautiful than we ever expected! The set up was true to what we discussed and the decorations were so dreamy! Throughout the whole event Amanda was right there for anything we needed! She directed everyone down the aisle and took my husband and I by golf-cart to the driftwood for our photos. She went above and beyond her job description - even helping our photographer to pose us and bustling my dress before the reception. We had a special request for a fire entertainer to perform over dinner which had never been done at Lover's Key before. This was initially declined, but Amanda unexpectedly made it happen! We were overjoyed and our guests are still raving about the performance and our unique venue.So in summary - Lover's Key State Park was the PERFECT venue for the beach wedding of our dreams! Amanda will ensure your wedding day is as perfect as it can be by going above and beyond her job description. Thank you so much Amanda for all you did to make our wedding day so special and so perfect. You really took the stress off of us so we could have a magical and fun wedding day!",Heather S.,5 star rating,"Deerfield Beach, FL","Miami, FL",Lovers Key State Park,yelp
12/15/2019,"Most people visit Wakulla in the hot & humid summer months so they can cool off in the 70 degree water, dry off & picnic, then jump back in the water to cool off again. But Wakulla is more than a respite from the heat. Take the boat tour during the colder weather months and you'll see much more wildlife because they're out taking advantage of the sunshine to warm up. On this day it was in the 50's, clear & sunny. We saw manatees of all sizes, clusters of baby alligators no more than 2-3 ft long, coots, herrings, hawks, and many more birds I don't recall the names of.

It was a little bit of a drive and you pay to get in but that wasn't an issue. I'm glad we got here early-ish because more people came but even then I felt parking wasn't ridiculous. The event had a lot of park rangers ready to help and the beach was there looking nice. We didn't spend a lot of time here so it deserves a second visit. I liked the area and the all the people working there and volunteering were great. My wife thinks she would be ok with coming back at least for the same event next year and making more of a day out of it. Maybe bring a picnic lunch and stay on the sand a little longer?  A lot of possibilities with this place.

12/19/2019,"Not for everyone! This is a unique but of Florida. Not exactly pristine... the entire tract was once used for logging, and the roads you'll travel on to access this remote area are in fact those clogging roads. We visited during a relatively dry period, yet one of the most promising trails was under water. We'll have to return in January perhaps to get access to that. The roads are definitely dirt. Lots of ruts, mud, rocks, and pot holes, they do keep up some level of maintenance evidenced in areas filled with gravel. We visited in our Prius, and with some careful aim and strategy, we were able to travel the entire length to where the road farther is closed off. Then we went to walk a bit more, only to find the path blocked by a large alligator.This is, as I said, a fairly unique place... there's a Royal Palm forest... perhaps the only such natural accessible stand. The tannin-stained water runs swiftly in this area, and you can get closeup with the intricate airplane and cypress understory. There are also lots of native butterflies here.The remoteness and limited access culls any crowds, so you'll probably see few other visitors.

12/24/2019,"My husband had been wanting to kayak to Nixon Beach and found that Bill Baggs Park was super close and had a kayak launch point. This park costs $8 to get into, but it's a large park with bike trails, a cafe, kayak launch spot, beaches, fishing areas and pavilions. It also wasn't super packed, but please note it was not in-season so it could be busier in winter months.The downside for trying to get to Nixon Beach from here is that the kayak launch spot is on the ocean side and on the north end of the park. We would have to kayak about 5 miles around Key Biscayne to the other side to get to the sandbar. So that was a huge disappointment. We launched from the southernmost beach by the light house. This is when I could see houses on stilts in the distance. You can kayak from this park out to Stiltsville about 1.5 miles which was super cool. The park has a historic lighthouse you can go up in and the views are supposed to be amazing.

3/21/2020,"Barron Collier's name is well known in this part of Florida. Collier earned his fortune in the trolley car advertising business. He had to foresight to see the economic opportunities involved with opening up the west coast of Florida and he invested heavily into building a highway that cut through the Everglades and ran from coast to coast in south Florida. 1920 he owned a million acres of land in this area. When Barron Collier died in March 1939, he was Florida's largest landowner. Part of his holdings included a rare stand of native royal palm trees that he reserved. The land was originally supposed to be a National Park but the federal government wasn't interested so the state of Florida stepped in and created a state park in 1947. The Seminole in the parks name reflects that before Collier owned the land it was the home of the Seminole Indians. There is a memorial to Barron Collier in the park. At the entrance to the park is a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark, the last existing Bay City Walking Dredge built in 1924. This large piece of equipment has historical significance. It is a walking dredge that was used to dig the Tamiami Canal in the 1920's. The 60 foot long machine would scoop the land between it's legs and then walk along before scooping again. The material was then placed next to the canal to form a road. The machine operated 6 days a week for ten hours a day. This road opened up the west coast of Florida to travelers. In May of 2013 the Bay City Walking Dredge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The park includes of 6,430 acres of mangrove swamp, cypress swamps, salt marshes, mangrove river estuaries, and pine flatwoods. Park amenities includes two nature trails, the .9 mile Royal Palm Hammock Trail and the 6 mile Collier-Seminole Trail. The Collier-Seminole trail requires wading through swamp water and you have to check in at the ranger station to get the combination for the gate. There are primitive camp sites on this trail. There is an an interpretive center located in a cypress log block house which was the type used by white settlers during the Second Seminole War. You can embark on 3.5 miles of hiking and biking trails or rent a canoe for the Blackwater River which originates in the park and travels several miles through the mangroves to Blackwater Bay and the Ten Thousand Islands, This park has a boat ramp, guided boat tours, and a campground. There is so much to do here and park admission is only $5. The .9 mile Royal Palm Hammock Trail is located adjacent to the picnic area. Part of the trail is natural earth and part is boardwalk. The trail starts out in a tropical and temperate hardwoods and then transitions into habitats that lead to the mangrove fringe along the edge of Florida Bay before ending at a platform overlooking a salt marsh. Along this trail are large royal palms, Jamaican dogwoods, and gumbo limbo trees.  You may see the colorful and endangered liguus tree snails climbing up the smooth bark of tropical trees. Bears and panthers pass through the hammock. Birds you may see here include red-shouldered hawks, white-crowned pigeon, cardinal, yellow-rumped warbler, black-throated blue warbler and the Swallow-tailed kite.   This is a great park to get out and enjoy nature while safely social distancing. There is a lot of history here and it is a wonderful place to hike, bike, boat, camp, picnic, and nature watch. Here is the latest message from the park service. ""Out of an abundance of caution, all events, activities, special event reservations, pavilion rentals and camping/cabin reservations at Florida State Parks have been canceled for the next 60 days.

3/24/2020,"This is a beautiful park offering lots of outdoor activities.  It offers kayaking, fishing, swimming, canoeing and scuba diving.  For those not interested in the water activities or looking for more things to do...there are hiking trails, a nice walkway/boardwalk along the water, camping and is the perfect place to watch nature. The seasonal ""stars"" of the park are the manatees in the winter and the very early spring months.  All said water activities will be halted when the manatees are there to protect them.  These gentle giants are amazing to watch and this is my favorite time to visit!  It is the perfect place to relax and just ""watch""...and ""listen"".  Why do the manatees like it here you may ask?  Because the water temperatures are fairly warm in the winter months.  The spring is connected to the St. Johns River and this waterway is connected to the ocean...perfect for coming and going.Yes, there is a little history too and here is a quick overview:  Once upon a time this was a plantation and the house still remains today.  Citrus trees were grown here until the killing freeze happened in the 1890's.  A minor railway had been built linking Orange City to the dock at the spring.  After the freeze, the owners (the Thursby's at the time) switched from growing citrus to the tourist industry...taking full advantage and benefit of the fishing, hunting and nature watching along the St. Johns River and spring.The Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection attained the property in 1972 to facilitate the manatee protection program.  The same manatees will migrate to the same spring every year and can be identified in different ways...like scars, abrasions, etc.  Researchers have monitored individual manatees, families and their lives at the spring since 1978 and it encompasses the world's largest manatee database.  Other Things:-  When the manatees are ""there"" it can get busy.  The park staff will only allow so many folks in and therefore, there may be a wait...be patient.-  There is a $6 per vehicle & a $2 per pedestrian entrance fee.  Annual pass holders get in free (along with everyone in the vehicle).-  Tip:  At the entrance there will be a chalkboard with the number of manatees spotted that day.-  The Thursby House is only open periodically.  If you wish to go inside, please contact the park for opening dates and times.-  There are restrooms, a snack bar and a gift shop.-  There is plenty of parking and overflow parking...please park in a designated spot since it can be a little tight in there.-  A separate company (St. Johns River Cruises) has cruise & kayak options for purchase.-  There are lots of historical signs and information throughout the park.  Please note that John Bartram visited there in 1766.-  There are several environmental concerns with the ecosystem.  The amount of humans visiting the springs has increased, right along with the number of manatees has increased as well.  Both humans and manatees create water pollution in different ways.  The manatees can't exactly clean up after themselves, but we can.  Please be respectful when visiting and dispose of all trash accordingly.Enjoy your visit!",Patricia L.,5 star rating,"St. Augustine, FL",,Blue Spring State Park,yelp

4/5/2020,We really enjoyed this park. I must have over 100 photos of manatees and there must have been around 250 of them in the park.

I believe we went in November.,Doni F.,5 star rating,"Saint Augustine, FL",,Blue Spring State Park,yelp
4/8/2020,"I used to come out here over 20 years ago, before it was a park. The pits that they call lakes were much more accessible to fish back then.  They are now all overgrown with vegetation, and not fishable from the banks.  Even the first pit on the north side is getting smaller.  The river is a hike to get to but worth it.  With patience, theirs a lot of wildlife to see.  This place is much more geared to please mountain bikers, with bike trails and a bike shop.  For horseback riders, there's plenty of room for the trailers and the rides would be relaxing.",Rob H.,4 star rating,"Fish Hawk, Lithia, FL",,Alafia River State Park,yelp

4/22/2020,"Not a lot going on at this park and not a lot to see. We opted to not purchase admission for the botanical garden at the park entrance because we thought we'd do more walking trails in the park. We paid the main park fee and left it at that. After realizing the park has nothing to do by way of walking trails, we went over to the garden center thinking we'd purchase tickets there and see the botanical garden after all. As we were walking up, a lady working in the office yelled at us that we couldn't come in without tickets. Like, based on the fact we weren't senior citizens, she assumed we'd be trying to pull a fast one on her and sneak in to the park. We are both working professionals in our 30s but she made us feel like we were some sort of botanical garden hooligans. It was incredibly offensive and she was extremely rude the more we interacted with her. We tried to explain that we just wanted to see if we could buy garden tickets at the office rather than drive back to the park entrance. She was so rude, we just cut her short and decided to leave altogether. She also had a small child in the office with her, so she was obviously busy with other things.

5/20/2020,"I absolutely love this state park! It's divided into 2 main areas: on one side of A1A there are the formal gardens and two trails; on the other is the beach with the coquina quarries. The rose gardens and fountains are well kept. Large oak trees and Spanish moss envelope the space which make it feel like you're not in Florida. I enjoyed reading about the history of the Youngs and how they made their Florida home into an attraction for foreign dignitaries and politicians back in the day. The trails are pretty easy to navigate and every so often there is a sign that points out certain flora within the area. There's also a tiny gnome garden in the middle of the park--blink and you might miss it!If you pass the Ranger post and cross A1A, you can also go the beach and see the coquina quarries.

5/25/2020,"Ah, Fort Clinch... One of my all time favorites among Florida's many state parks. Partly because it is close to home but mostly for the diverse landscape. There is the Fort, of course for history buffs, but the Fort is only one of the park's many treasures. If you enjoy being near the water, you are surrounded by it here. On one side of the park is the Atlantic Ocean and plenty of beach to stroll, fish, sunbathe or swim (watch the currents!). On the other side is the Amelia River. If you sit on the river side by the Fort and look across to Georgia's Cumberland Island, you might catch a glimpse of some wild horses. The park is also a great place to do some camping, either on the ocean side or under the shady forested canopy of the riverside campground. Bicycling through the park is quite popular, and there are plenty of nature trails for hiking and nature photography. Wherever you go in the park, you are likely to spot one of the many whitetail deer that make their home here.",Mark D.,5 star rating,"Yulee, FL",,Fort Clinch State Park,yelp

Afterwards, we took a walk around the trails to see what remained of this once-upon-a-time roadside theme park/attraction. The signs were well defined and the trails cemented. Off in one area you can see some of the cages where the park kept the animals back in the day and what's left of the butterfly gardens. The best part, though, are the waterfalls!

They told her what we were doing and that I would have my service dog with me. She clearly wasn't happy about it as she reminded them that they close at dusk. Now...for non-islanders, dusk is the moment the sun disappears. When we were there, that was around 8:30 as sunset starts at 8:15. When we got there, the lady attendant in the booth rudely told us they close at 8. Not 8:01, 8:02......and more. We said ok and went on to meet our photographer. As we were getting out and headed to the beach in our wedding beauty, another worker lady stopped to say hi and to offer any help we wanted. We were lucky enough to get to meet her again when we came back a couple days later. She was so kind and helpful and I didn't feel a moment of discrimination about my service dog or sexual orientation. She simply treated us with respect and was so fun just to talk to. She should be in charge. We stopped at 7:55, despite the lack of sunset we were wanting for pictures. We loaded our car and we're getting in at 8:03. Up comes snotty pants to literally point at us and then jerk her thumb as if to say, ""Get the F out."" Not a word. Just a rude thumbs gone.

The path includes a stop at the largest (highest) mound which includes a nice overlook of the Crystal River. The path itself includes several signs explaining the historical significance of the area. This includes other mounds, rock formations and the original natives that inhabited this land. Aside from the archeological portion, you'll likely see some interesting critters back here. We hadn't taken 20 steps on the path before seeing two of the largest grasshoppers we'd ever seen.  There's also a tree with a door at its base. If you're looking for added adventure try and find it.  The museum was closed on our visit which surely has some interesting relics and more information about the native Americans that once lived here.

6/20/2020,"One of my favorite springs . From Hollywood FLA is about a 5 and a half hour  drive. Make sure to get there when it first opens at 8 am because there is a quota and once it's filled you have to wait hours to get in. What you do in this spring is go tubbing for 1and a half hours . You can rent the tub at the site for 8 dollars and above for bigger tubes and the trolley ride is about 6 dollars extra. Once you get off the trolley with your tube it's a short five minute walk where you launch off best to aim your behind to the hole on the tube and if you have a friend tie a rope to the tubes . Disposable water bottles are not allowed but regular water bottles are ,no food, no smoking, no drinking alcohol. Don't make the mistake I made of jumping off the inner tube because you won't get back on ,the water is crystal clear and deep icy cold 72 degrees . As you drift down this spring you can see wild life , birds, big fish, alligators ,snakes and turtles. I swam the entire 1 and a half  a little bit frighten because of the large fish and snakes but I was not harmed at all.Once you finish you hop back on trolly with inner tube and you can do it all over again .

6/21/2020,"If you're planning to camp here it is best to go online and make a reservation. Sites usually fill weeks in advance. Camp sites with water and electricity are bunched together about 500 feet from the water. Be aware the the electrical hook up is for travel trailers and if you're tent camping you need to bring a converter cable. Bathrooms and showers are also in close proximity of the campgrounds. Dogs are allowed on these sites but not in or around the water. There are several nice pavilions perfect for large family parties. The water is beautiful clear turquoise but be aware that as with most Florida fresh water springs the water temperature will be in the low 70's even on hot summer days. A long sleeve shirt or rash guard will help keep you warmer and the experience more enjoyable. For daytime visitors the park is open from 8am till sundown after which people who camp here may enjoy the spring with very few other people. We felt safe and secure here, even left our gear sitting outside just like everyone else. All campers were respectful and kept the noise level down to a minimum.

Then there was holes everywhere in the tent and when it rained everything got soaked. The a/c unit  took forever to start cooling and never really cooled until the evening time. There was nothing to see while kayaking. We were just kayaking for the sake of saying we did. Fishing was tough because all of the Lilly pads that made it almost impossible to bring up a fish with out the line snapping. We weren't able to go horseback riding because it was booked for two weeks out. This was not at all what we were expecting when we planned a carefree camping experience.

There are no disposable containers or beverages allowed or coolers so pretty much a thermos is about it or yeti style cup etc...   the staff is great and attentive and just a very relaxing time to be had. I would recommend bringing some swim goggles or dive mask because it is nice to peek under the water and see the fish swimming below you. I had to borrow my daughters as Shaw's not as pumped up to see the wildlife below her The water is crystal clear and about 72f all year so it was very comfortable and relaxing spring feed adventure. There is no need to bring a tube as they provide them. It is important though to arrive very early as the stop taking people once a certain number is hit. We arrived at 08:00 to make it.

Would love to come back and check out the gift shop and visitor center but they were closed, I assume due to Covid.  Across the street on the beach side is just as beautiful as the garden, maybe even better depending on your taste.

I watched as that thing filled with 30-40 people and clearly it was overloaded. Not a single lifeguard made people get off! The beach areas are kinda sad..mostly old sand and good luck finding a place to sit. We went for the mermaids...the mermaids were the best. Other than that. I won't be back to swim.

The boardwalk is halfway gone. There's bobbers you can't pass so you can float down. It's horrible, will never go back. I wish the old owners still owned it.

7/18/2020,"The campground here is one of the nicer state park options in the area... well maintained trails right along the river, a swimming hole, and lots of longer bike trails (which we'll come back to in cooler months!).Many camp sites have plenty of shade. Our site needed an extra-long water hose (about 50' plus our normal hose)... fortunately we had one in our gear. Although many sites are along the River, you can't get to it unless you take the trails outside the campground. There is a nice footbridge over the river that was near our site that provided quick access to the riverside trail on the other side.Although shaded and surrounded by trees and underbrush, there was a nice breeze here also.The park is not as remote as Myakka, so there is easy access to lots of local eateries who provide curbside pickup.

7/19/2020,"South West Florida is known for its gorgeous beaches and sunsets. The Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park is one of the nicest beaches in the area. It was about $6 to get in and the friendly lady at the front gate lets you know that the park closes at 8:20pm, not 6pm which is shown on both the yelp page and online. The park closes when the sun goes down. I had been planning a photoshoot with a friend for a while. We needed to find a place where we could get good shots by the beach. She is originally from fort Myers and wanted to come down to Naples to shoot and she told me to come here. It was gorgeous. The atmosphere and seeing the perfect sunset was one of my favorite parts. One of the best things that I noticed when I was stepping foot on this beach is that it everyone stays away from one another. It is not like other beaches where people are on top of one another.

Due to Covid there are restrictions to the amount of people in the park which I greatly appreciated. The park closes for the day once the parking lot is full. The lot becomes full between 8:30-10. The time depends on if you visit on a weekday or weekend. The park fills up fast on the weekends.  There is a two dollar per person admission fee and cash (exact only) or card is accepted. The park was beautiful and the spring fed water was so pretty. We al swam and snorkeled all day! The weather was great and everybody was social distancing. There is a ton of space to distance as well. This is a must visit park when you are in Florida. The surroundings make you think that you are not in Florida due to no palm trees being in the park.

7/21/2020,Beautiful!  There is a small courtyard area that has pavilions and picnic tables by a shaded yard where you can set up corn hole or other yard games.  The facilities include two port-a-potties which were cleaner than I expected.  We had lunch then walked the trail to the beach area.  The sandy trail was about a 10 minute hike through a wooded area that was very green and it led to a tree-littered beach.  There are so many uprooted gray trees making for a beautiful scenery.  This island was a great spot for me because it satisfied my hiking and seaside craving in one trip.,Nicole J.,5 star rating,"Orange Park, FL",,Big Talbot Island State Park,yelp
7/21/2020,"Blue Springs is a great spot for some fun outdoor activities! Tip: get there early (they open at 8am) if you wait too long you may not get in. We got there a little after 9 and they were at capacity by 10 and this was on a Tuesday. They are doing limited capacity as well because of COVID so keep that in mind as well! You can bring in your own kayak, paddleboard, floats, etc or rent them there. It's $6 for a car load (up to 8 people) and other rentals vary in price. For the tubes to float it was $6 for the first hour and $3 for every additional hour. We did not bring tubes but we will for next time since we can buy a tube for less than the price we paid to rent. Part of the run was closed due to downed trees but we were still able to walk the boardwalks and see the spring at the head. The water was chilly at first but also incredibly refreshing on a hot day! After returning our tubes we walked around the property and watched various wildlife. It was really neat to be able to see huge gar and other fish in the water, we saw an alligator too! We did not see any manatees but I know blue spring is a spot they like to hang out at! You can bring in a cooler for lunches, no alcohol though just FYI.

We did over thirty minutes of hiking on the nature trail. There were people walking, hiking and riding bikes throughout the state park.

The staff was very helpful and resolved an issue we had with the traditional tent very quickly. We went kayaking/canoeing twice which is ok, but not much to see and on a smaller lake.  My older two daughters and wife went on a 1 hour trail ride and enjoyed it.  The kids also enjoyed the swimming beach.",Matthew P.,4 star rating,"Tampa, FL",,Lake Louisa State Park,yelp
7/25/2020,"Well-kept river and premises and an overall great experience, although I'd consider it a little expensive in my opinion. It's a 3rd-party company operating the rental and it is $20 per tube for a 2 hour experience. For access, note that you must enter through separate tubing entrance and not the main park entrance. The entry fee to the State Park is $2 like most, and you'll pay for all your rentals and entry at the access gate.There is a pretty small parking lot, which can fill up fast (it's also super duper hour asphalt, so think about your feet in advance). Staff at the building are nice, but the kids helping with the tubes are pretty complacent. I get it, they're teenagers. The rental tubes were OK, but 80% needed alot more air that the kids were too reluctant (lazy) to do that morning. Overall, the river is amazing - clear, clean, perfectly cool, relaxing - but, the 3rd party company operating the rental service is mediocre. While your entry fee into the tubing gets you into the main park as well, it will be hit or miss on whether you actually can get in before they are full. I think it's almost impossible to visit both, since you need to be there early for both.Ultimately, I would recommend bringing your own tubes (if you plan on ever tubing twice in your life it will be more cost-effective), wearing water socks (parking lot asphalt is unbearable), start early and visit the main spring first to guarantee entry. Consider looking into K.P. Hole if you want a longer experience (4 hours, instead of 2) or a cheaper one.",Greg C.,4 star rating,"Mount Dora, FL",,Rainbow Springs State Park,yelp
7/26/2020,"I've been here over a year ago and I love coming here because of how remote it is. However on today's walk some of the paths have had fallen trees take over by the river and the paths have not been well maintained. There is water access if you wish to go swimming in the river itself. I didn't get through the field trails as a thunderstorm approached and scared my one pup with me. The field trails grass was a little long, but with the dead grass being left from previous cuttings the trail is being maintained. I definitely recommend visiting here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. You can enjoy walking around mask free without the fear or running into tons of people. There is no fee to park here, but there are also no restrooms/water stations.

They are well-tended and woodsy.  Just beautiful. I was able to get sites close to the bathrooms, which are clean and well-kept.  I camp in a tent so that's important to be able to get close.

So much fun!  Totally recommend this Park.  It is fairly close to Orlando, but just far enough away where it is still out in natural Florida.  There is an old house (museum) there which was interesting to tour and I took the riverboat tour which was fun and great to get out on the water with.   I did get a lot of chigger bites the first time around, so there is that, but it is out in the woods....   Over all a beautiful park and definitely recommended.",Ruth V.,5 star rating,"Jacksonville, FL",,Blue Spring State Park,yelp

8/4/2020,"Anatasia State Park rewards you with pristine, secluded beaches plus some solid nature trails. There's a massive parking lot with a restroom facility when you enter. You can park close to the beach or go to the trailheads directly. We both nature trails: Spanish Quarry and Ancient Dunes. Spanish Quarry was poorly signed and is incredibly short. Not worth doing in my opinion. Ancient Dunes was a solid little loop where we saw plenty of wildlife including an osprey eating a fish plus you get tons of informational placards along the way to identify native plants.The beach itself is one of the best I've been to. It's massive with hardly anyone in sight. We had the whole place to ourselves.Overall, highly recommended!",GT W.,5 star rating,"Oceanside, CA",,Anastasia State Park,yelp

We had 2 chairs, a cooler, an umbrella, and a beach bag and we may have turned back half way there had it not been for our beach wagon with big tires.

8/5/2020,"Grayton Beach State park is a stunningly beautiful camping and beach facility. Well maintained roads, campsites, buildings and beaches make this area conducive to a relaxing stay. Although they do have a bit of a ""Bob"" problem.As I was walking my dog around the park at 12:15pm for the last tour before departure, in the campsite next to mine (#11) sat a golf cart backed into place. I nodded and spoke to the occupant while passing. His response? ""You in number 11?"" ""Yes"", I replied. Without missing a beat, he stated firmly, ""checkout time is 1"". I looked at my watch  and said ""45 minutes"" and continued on with my cruise around the area. Having pulled the slideouts, water line and such on my 26 ft Navion class C and while disconnecting the sewer hose (complete with traditional thick rubber gloves) Maskless Bob, a volunteer, approached from his golf cart at 13:01:30pm and said ""you gonna be long? You're supposed to be out by one and there are people wanting to get into this slot"" ""Check in time is at three, correct?"" I asked. ""You're supposed to be out by one"" he replied, in a rude,gruff, authoritarian growl, fitting a power starved volunteer, overseeing his domain. "" Well, standing here discussing it with you isn't accelerating the effort much now is it uh, Bob""? "" and went on about the fun business of continuing the disconnection of the ""honey pot"" line.When I reached the office building at 13:08:20 I stopped to pass along this conversation with the rangers, one of whom kinda smiled and said ""well Bob's kinda straight forward"" and I replied ""no, Bob is just rude,I'm straight forward"". They listened to the complaint and I made it short because after all whatta gonna do?Good communication skills are important tools in any walk of life and follow up training, even of volunteers, can make the difference between good reviews and not so good ones.

8/5/2020,"Weekie Fresh Water Adventures - Kayak Rental Concessionair This company is a poorly run business that only cares about their bottom line and not the river. My family and I have been going to Weekie Wachee for years and will no longer be going back as long as this concessionaire is under the current ownership. Their reservation system is pure chaos. It took us 4 different reservations made on multiple days just to be able to have our family go down the river together. Then, at check-in, our reservations were completely mixed up and the staff blamed us. Their staff is extremely rude and unhelpful. If you try to call them, you get bounced around and then just disconnected and voicemails are never returned.On our most recent trip, we had children (7-9) with us. Because they were a little slower and we were going against the wind at the bottom part of the river, and we were enjoying our experience, it took us more than 4 hours. As such, we were shocked when they advised us we were going to be charged $100 dollars in late fees on top of the $100+ we were forced to spend on their kayak rentals, even though we had our own. It was such a bad experience we cancelled our future reservations and left town a day early as we feared we would not be able to get down the river within their timeframe and would incur more outrageous late fees.This concessionaire reserves half of the regulated amount of people the State allows down the river for their own rentals. There may be spots available for a given hour, but if the private launches they set aside are already booked, then they would let spots go unreserved before converting one of their $37 (single) or $59 (tandem) ""self-guided"" rental spots to a $10 private launch. If you are on a private launch, the timeframe listed on the reservation is still 4 hours, but there are no late fees. But, since we were forced to rent their kayaks, and could not get back within their timeframe, we were squeezed for additional fees. Racket!!In summation, the river is awesome, but this concessionaire has sucked the life out of the experience and they are just preying on and taking advantage of the tourists who attempt to visit. Read the Google reviews - there is a common theme. This company should be added to the CNBC TV series, ""American Greed"".

There's beauty in nature and it doesn't take a panoramic view of the ocean to guess that Miami captures South Florida's flora scene at a quintessential level. There's a reason DJ Khaled says ""We da best.""Usually it's referred to as ""El Farito"" for its pivotal lighthouse located at the end by Miami locals but the plentiful variety of trees encompassing its lushly vegetative surroundings are truly awe-inspiring. You tend to find yourself in nature which is something we all need more of in our overly congested and sometimes overwhelmingly intense city.

There were multiple holes that was only approximated with a tape, good thing it didn't rained hard during our stay! The AC had leaked overnight, and the other tent my cousin rented did not deliver at all- her kids couldnt stay inside their tent past 10am because its too hot! Their AC was small and the traditional type so i think each tents has different AC system. But i will give the bathrooms/rest areas 5 stars as they were kept clean with supplies throughout our stay and well ventilated. There's also a faucet on each sites which is a huge plus for me.

Even the guy at the gate collecting the entry fee did not mention it, even when we asked him where we could rent the bikes. So, none of the rentals were available when we arrived there.

8/14/2020,"Many of the campsites here are nice and large, and there are natural barriers between sites (palmetto and pine). Most have plenty of shade, but in a couple areas you can see a fire has gone through and cleared some of the tree cover. From a purely utilitarian point of view, the water is good, with plenty of pressure, and they have relief fittings, and each site has a sprinkler as well (probably a deterrent to fire). Many sites have two 6x6 poles for hanging a hammock. The electricity is stable, even during strong afternoon thunderstorms. There's a good cell signal here with AT&T, and strong television reception.We've been here twice now and the gravel sites are so perfectly level that I was being extra picky to bother with leveling the wheels ... it would have been fine without.The campground has nice trails that take you through the palmetto, pine, and oak landscape. And, there's a floating dock near a day use area on the lake. As a photographer, most of the available subjects here are probably macros of flowers and all the other native plants and butterflies. You can get some nice shots of undisturbed Florida pine lands as well. At the right time of year I'm sure the lake would be a draw for birds, but you'd need a capable telephoto.This park is close to restaurants and stores. We discovered a great little craft brewery with amazing food just 10 minutes away (Naughty Monk). It's also a relatively short trip to the gulf shore.

8/18/2020,"Me, my husband, and our two friends enjoyed one night camping trip at Bahia Mar!We booked last minute so took the last spot at campground #77. On a day with no cloud cover, it will be incredibly hot at #77. We were on the tents only side. If we were to come back on the tent only side we'd choose spot #76 or #75. #76 has a lot of trees for shade, and #75 has a straight view of the marina and might have gotten more wind at night than us. We happened to go on a very hot night. Weather said it felt like 88-90F at night. We had a tent with netting on top and there was almost no wind on top of the hot temperatures. No fault of the campground, but if we were to come back we'd stay on the RV side in spots 18-22, as those are right on the water and look beautiful! We enjoyed riding our bikes around the campground (so highly recommend bringing your bikes!). Other campers were friendly and respectful. The concession store has anything you might need: ice, snorkels, bar food, ice cream, towels, medication, etc. Really, anything that you might need you can find there!Staff was very friendly and helpful. We went over to the Atlantic side for the sunrise in the morning, and went over to the tents only side (our side) for the sunset.Overall, great campground and amenities. Would recommend!",Trang L.,5 star rating,"Parkland, FL",,Bahia Honda State Park,yelp
8/18/2020,"I can definitely see why this beach has a high star rating. It's not overcrowded. The park itself is beautiful with many trees and picnic tables with shade. Umbrellas, chairs and snorkel gear is available to rent for a small charge of $30 for one umbrella and two chairs. The beach is VERY rocky though and not at all what I had in mind when choosing this beach. Water shoes are highly suggested! The water isn't very clear either which I'm sure differs at certain parts of the year. Since it is a state park there is a fee of $7 to enter which includes parking. Music is allowed at a low volume near your area but thankfully, loud music is not allowed. (Not everyone loves the same type of music!) There are signs throughout the park grounds that read ""no alcohol allowed"". However, we noticed people with coolers of beer and there is a cafe that sells daiquiri's and piña colada's,  wine and beer. They also have snack type foods. Bring a towel, swim shoes and money for the chair rentals and have a nice day listening to the waves crash at this non overcrowded beach.",Erica S.,4 star rating,"Houston, TX",,Fort Zachary Taylor State Park Beach,yelp

8/19/2020,We went to go tubing on a Wednesday morning thinking it would be less crowded on a weekday and that an outdoor activity might be safe during this time. We were disappointed by the safety precautions in place and ended up leaving because we did not feel safe. The attendant collecting fees and distributing the release forms was not wearing a mask and there were large groups of guests gathering in the parking lot and waiting for the shuttle. No one was wearing masks. We sat in the parking lot debating whether to go and ultimately decided that riding in a shuttle with this many people was not a good idea. They did give us a refund without any questions asked.,Kim S.,2 star rating,"Rockville, MD",,Rainbow Springs State Park,yelp

8/20/2020,"Whats not to love about one of the country's last remaining prairie's? This park is wonderful and a real gem in North Central Florida. No matter what you are going to this park for, you are for sure in for a great day. I have been to this park on a handful of occasions since living in Gainesville. There is something for everyone. If you want to hike, you can do that. If you would rather take a picnic or bbq you can do that. You can see some pretty cool things here and its worth a day trip. When you arrive at the park it is $6 for a car load of people. I have a Florida State Parks pass so when I bring guests its only $2 per guest and if I have more than 3 guests its the flat $6. The rangers at this park are always very willing to give a map and some direction of where you should check out. The park does have a campground, but you do need to reserve your spot early as spots fill quickly and are limited. I love going on hikes there to the observation towers. I also enjoy the view of  the lake and other areas. I highly recommend this park to anyone! You can get that gorgeous picture of a sunset over a beautiful prairie.",Matthew L.,5 star rating,"Gainesville, FL",,Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park,yelp
8/21/2020,"Very disappointed in the service while renting chairs and an umbrella for my wife, our 4 month old daughter, and I. We arrived at 12:50pm and had to rent an umbrella because the ground is too hard and rocky to put up your own umbrella. Our baby needs shade, so we saw no other option than paying the $37 to rent. We asked maybe 10 minutes after being there if we could get a refund because it was so rocky we can't take our baby in the water. The water kept throwing rocks at our feet with the waves. Definitely not a kid friendly or relaxing beach to say the least. Anyways, we asked for a refund and they told us they could give us half back even though at this point it had only been 20 minutes by the time the manager came to us. I walked down the beach awhile to see if there was an area with less rocks but there wasn't. So we got our stuff and asked for our half refund. They said it had now been too much time to refund anything... it had been 1 hour since we arrived at the beach. They saw we didn't get in the water, we didn't even unpack our things. The 2 men at the rental booth said we should have known what the water was like and they didn't force us to rent so it's our fault. It's our fault for bringing our baby. Last time I checked, customer service employees are supposed to care about their customers and help them out so they can get future business. We will never come back to this beach. We essentially paid $44 for one hour of beach time (including the park fee). Don't go to this park unless you want horrible service. There are plenty of other beaches that are beautiful with nice sand and family friendly. (Like Bahia Honda)!",Jonathan R.,1 star rating,"Middlesex, NJ",,Fort Zachary Taylor State Park Beach,yelp

There is also a pavilion in the center of the grassy area if you are looking for some shade.  Having visited both pre and post covid, it is nice to see not much has changed and continues to be a pocket of serenity amidst the hubbub of surrounding restaurants and stores.

I don't remember it from my last visit. The park serves to rehabilitate injured wildlife and animals who can't  be released back to the wild become permanent residents. We were able to experience feeling time for the birds. It was the coolest things to watch. The staff are amazing and truly love the animals they care for.  You can get to the park via tram or boat.

8/30/2020,"I really enjoyed my morning trip to caladesi island. It starts with the ferry ride which is about 15 minutes. It's a nice ferry trip to the island and they share some history of both honeymoon and caladesi islands (they used to be combined!) so it was a means of transportation but also a mini tour and the captains are super nice and friendly. Make sure to bring some singles for the tip jar! They ferry runs every 30 minutes and you have a designated return time. You can come back early unless they are at capacity but they say it's never a problem. We did return early and were allowed to do so. When you get to caladesi there is a small cafe and shop where you can buy sunscreen, hats, bug spray, tshirts etc and also food. This is also where you can rent kayaks to explore the nature trail/mangroves. This is a 3 hour kayak path and the rental is for 3 hours. I think they are a little lenient on return time as long as they aren't busy but don't quote me on that. It's $25 per person for kayaks and they have single and doubles. The mangroves are really pretty and completely enclosed. Bring bug spray!! If you forget to pack it, buy it at the cafe spot before you head out. It is buggy!! There are also kayak rentals on the beach. There is a walking nature trail which is nice to explore the island. The beaches are super nice and very easy to find a private spot. Make sure to bring your own chairs, food, water etc bc this is not the place that is the most convenient to go back to the store to grab a bottle of water or snack. There is a decent amount of walking to get place to place but if you are looking for a nice beach day with beautiful waters and sand, this is a great place for you!

There are only a few rooms that you can go into the others you just look through the window and see how it would have been back in the 1800s.  After the fort we made our way to Willow pond and took a nice 25-minute hike through the woods. There is also a lighthouse that you can see but we forgot to go look at it!!    We did check out the campgrounds  before heading out.

9/6/2020,"Fort Clinch is a must-see if you are visiting Amelia Island.Tickets to gain entry into the park are $6 per carload. It's a beautiful 8-10-minute drive through the park before reaching the main parking lot and visitor center. The visitor center has bathrooms, food, merchandise, and a small seating area where you can take a load off. Tickets to acquire access to the museum and fort can be purchased in the visitor center for $2.50 per person.Although the museum is quite small it provides a great opportunity for visitors to understand the history and purpose behind the fort. Fort construction began in 1847 shortly after the Second Seminole War. The fort is located at the mouth of the St. Mary's River and was used to protect the port of Fernandina. Although the fort was not completed, it was still utilized as a military base during the Civil War, Spanish American War, and World War II.Today, Fort Clinch is known as one of Florida's first state parks. The park is nestled on 2,178 acres and includes a variety of amenities such as: exploring the Civil War-era fort and museum, walking scenic hiking trails, swimming, fishing, shark tooth hunting, birding, and shelling along the beautiful beach line. Also, the park accommodates camping at any of the sixty-three (63) campsites which are equipped with electricity and water or roughing-it at one of the six (6) primitive campsites.I thought this park was awesome! We spent most of our time here exploring the fort, museum, and some of the trails. However, we managed to miss out on visiting the lighthouse, which is one of the main attractions. I highly recommend stopping here if you're a photographer, the fort provides some great scenery and angles that can be appreciated. If it wasn't so hot outside, I think we would have spent several hours wandering around taking more pictures.If you are in the area, definitely stop by and check this park out.

If you do, be sure to tip the boat captain. When you get off the boat there is a small concession stand type restaurant. The beach is a 6-7 min walk from the boat and food area.

Signs are everywhere, asking visitors to follow social distancing guidelines and to avoid crowds. We didn't see too many campers, and the sign at the entrance indicated that the campground was full, so they are limiting capacity. Today we drove to the parking area by the river. Longer trails start here. We only wanted a mile or less round trip trail, so we drove to the boat ramp, past the campsites. The River Trail starts here, .7 miles each way. We walked 1.2 miles round trip. We saw butterflies and bobwhites. We also visited the bathrooms, which have showers, too. Water fountains, a sink, bulletin board, and pet station are outside this comfort station. Both bathrooms are cleaned daily between 10:30-11:30. This is where we will return to camp for meteor showers! It has no lights, except at the bathrooms, and I think it is $18 a night. We are over 65, so I think we get it for 50% off.

It was always there,  as I rode my bike past on the way to Dinner Key or when I would go to the Coconut Grove Playhouse, or Greenstreets, or Ranis. You know all these places remember? I felt it there as I would drive past this little swath of land known as The Barnacle for it's quirky looking home built by Munro back in the early days of this city.I finally walked in to this little bit of paradise and wonder why I never took the time to drop in before.It's a lovely walk to the sea side along a tree filled path dripping with Spanish moss and hiding the ubiquitous developments on either side that remind one that we are squeezing the life out of our magic city. But this little piece of paradise found still stands as one of a dozen or so homes that were first built in this area - pioneers and rugged fun people indeed.It's a best kept secret and hope it stays that way.It's a $2 entry with an honor system.

9/8/2020,"Overall this was a great experience . We rented a kayak and paddle board. The beginning of the River was beautiful , we saw fish swimming and also a manatee. I got scared when I saw a small snake swimming toward my kayak, so just that people are aware anything can be swimming in the river. There was random trees with ropes to jump off of on the river , you can also pull over anywhere and swim .As we went down the river it got busier. This is why I took away a star. The workers did not tell us how crazy it got . We did go in Labor Day weekend , but we had no idea JETSKIS AND PONTOON BOATS were on this small river . It became chaotic with boats tailgating kayaks and paddle boards and the water got dirtier . Overall I didn't like the ending . It took about 3 hours to kayak until the end point . I just didn't like how it started to become not safe anymore towards the end. There were hundreds of people on the river . I probably wouldn't go again because of that. The beginning was amazing though .",Veronica K.,4 star rating,"Riverwoods, IL",,Weeki Wachee Springs,yelp

It is pretty cool. Afterward, we drove to the end where the boat tours and bike and kayak rentals are. We considered doing a boat tour, but because of social distancing, their capacity is extremely limited and we were not able to get on the boat. The next boat was leaving an hour and a half later and we didn't feel like waiting around that long. There are lots of places to picnic and several families were riding bikes through the park.

Service once we checked in was quick and felt safe as everyone was wearing masks. They made us throw out our energy bars and napkins but that's understandable to keep the place clean. We went on a Sunday morning and it was very busy with kayakers paddlers and boaters alone. Sometimes you spot manatees which is pretty cool. It took 2 hours to kayak about 6 miles The shuttle process was smooth and easy. Thanks to the guy that pulled us up at the end so we wouldn't have to step in the water coming out.

If you want something hard to drink you can walk to their snack shake to get a beer and maybe catch sight of a Manatee, which we unfortunately did not see while there. My favorite part of this beach was that the picnic tables are right next to the beach and give a great view of ocean while you picnic. Parking is $6 for the whole day so that is pretty affordable compared to some of the public city lots. Is this the best beach in the Fort Lauderdale area?

9/28/2020,"I am an avid State Park fan here in Fl, so it's no surprise that this is a 5 star review! Once inside the park, there is a view of the intercoastal waterway, where the breeze was glorious. I did bug spray up as soon as I exited the car- which I highly recommend if the bloodsuckers like you. There is a screened in pavilion you can normally rent for events- closed right now due to Covid. There is a little dock a family was fishing from and a small watercraft launch, I can only imagine kayaking from here would be beautiful. Plenty of trails including a 7 miler to the next state park. We hiked back to the site of slave cabins- all that was left was the stone base of what was a hearth and fireplace. This site is a previous plantation. My heart aches when I see that they had slaves to run their sugar mill and also grew and processed indigo- which was highly poisonous to those working directly with extracting the dye from the plant. A death sentence for those assigned that job. I know this from a previous tour at another plantation. I am happy that that part of our history is in the past and I hope we continue to learn from those times and never repeat the mistakes of the past. The ruins are further down the road, the hiking trail back was closed (probably due to high water levels). This area was swarming with mosquitos- I reapplied bug spray for good measure- just dip me in deet. This however was my favorite part~ my inner-artist took hold and I ran rampart taking pictures. We were lucky that we toured the ruins by ourselves. No one else was out there while we explored. I easily spent 45 minutes just snapping pictures. Probably more than you would need. The average person would probably only spend 15-20 minutes walking around and reading the information boards. There is a building off to the side that has tools and things recovered from the area. I love that you can walk through the ruins on a sidewalk that is chained off from you entering into any of the structures- preserving what remains, but allowing you a special glimpse from ""inside"" the ruins. I recently visited another park that had the large ruins completely closed off- only external views. So this was a treat.You could spend as little as 45 minutes going through this park or spend the day hiking and picnicking.

10/1/2020,"WOW! Boneyard Beach is so cool! My son & future DIL have been here several times, and I'd seen so many photos of theirs that hubs & I wanted to experience it for ourselves. During our last visit with them in late August 2020, on a busy Saturday afternoon, the small parking area was so full that driving through was almost impossible. We ended up parking along the main road and walking back to Black Rock Trail, then walking another 10 minutes or so to get to the beach. But the effort was completely worthwhile! The huge pieces of driftwood and fallen uprooted trees are stunning, and the beach is incredibly pristine. Our visit was during a very low tide, and we were able to safely wade in the water. My son mentioned that on their prior visits, during higher tides, driftwood hidden below the waterline was a serious hazard. For this reason, going in the water is usually not a good idea, so this was the first time they had felt comfortable walking knee-deep into the surf. The sand here was incredibly soft, both on the beach and in the water, which made barefoot walking quite comfortable. The large exposed rock shelf further up the beach was a little rough on the feet, but definitely too interesting & unusual to skip. It's an equally fascinating area of natural geographic artistry. My son also mentioned that parking had not been as challenging on their prior visits, the first of which had been pre-pandemic. That's said, we did not feel like the beach was crowded at all. Despite the many cars, the beach area is so vast that small groups could easily avoid each other, especially since this isn't your typical sunbathing/relaxing beach and most people are on the move to enjoy this unique stretch of Florida.

10/4/2020,"I absolutely love coming to the beach at this park. This is definitely one of those Miami spots you have to visit while you're in Town if you're not from around here and it's more than worth the $8 entrance fee.Miami Natives lovingly call this place ""el farito"" for the beautiful lighthouse at the end of the island. But that's not all you'll see when you visit; there's so much wildlife roaming around, you shouldn't freak out if you see a raccoon or iguana or even a huge school of fish swim by if you're in the water. For $25 you can rent two beach chairs and an umbrella and have the best beach day ever like I did in the photos attached. During the summer, the waters are mostly crystal clear and the riptide isn't too bad. Sharks have been spotted here before but I think South Beach gets much more shark action lol There are two restaurants in Bill Baggs. My favorite one is the one at the end nearest the lighthouse. They have tons of food and it's really fresh and delicious. The park has really clean bathrooms and trash bins everywhere for collecting garbage, which is really convenient because everyone has things they wanna get rid of before leaving their beach day and heading back to the car. Fresh water showers are also available. All CDC guidelines for COVID-19 and social distancing are in place with signage and park service aides riding around/keeping an eye out.

Blue Spring State Park is renowned for its position as a manatee refuge; therefore, while up in Orlando for the Gaylord Ice exhibit during the in-season, we first made a trek to the park to see them. Located in Orange Park, Blue Spring is a little out of the way if you're visiting the Orlando/Kissimmee area, but it's great if you really love manatees and want a quiet retreat from all things Universal and Disney. After making our way to the park entrance after an hour-plus drive, we made our way through the winding road to the main parking area where we would have easy access to view the manatees from one of the dock viewing areas. I was amazed by the number of manatees I saw as we made our way to each of the docking areas. They really have a large number of manatees in the park. We didn't see as many as 200, but we did see quite a few.

They really need to widen the spaces by removing a few shrubs at most sites.  It was clostrophobic to go in and out of our rig as the door opened into the bushes and we could not extend our awning. I looked and this was the case at most of the sites.  While long enough, they are far too narrow.  So much so that the fire ring and table are at the back of most sites..",Cynthia M.,3 star rating,"Merritt Island, FL",,Koreshan State Park,yelp

Lots of trees, water, flowers, fountains, etc. We walked one of the nature trails. It was an easy walk on a very wide path. I'd suggest going here early in the day. It started to get pretty hot by 11 AM. I don't understand why the gift shop and visitors center aren't reopened yet. Didn't the governor open everything in the state? I was disappointed to not be able to go inside any of the buildings. It was a week day and there weren't many people.

10/16/2020,"Great state park with lots of beach options, a boat launch, a restaurant, some shore dive spots on a man made reef, and hidden kayak/paddle boarding, and some biking trails. You can also to grilling on the charcoal grills, lounging in the shady coverings near the water, spend time on the beach, or chill at whiskey creek. Check out my full review of Whiskey Creek to read all about that, which is the main attraction of this park. They also have a boat launch which lets you get access to the whiskey creek spot or the inter-coastal. From there you could get into the ocean, or cruise down up or down. You can even go by the cruise ships, which is always fun. As far as the diving goes, there is a man-made reef called the ""jax"" right off of parking spot 1. look up the map to see exactly where it is, but you go straight out and you will end up on it. This is a great spot for a few different coral sightings, some fish, turtles, and maybe even something more exciting. I haven't used the biking trails, but I see lots of people riding around on them.

10/18/2020,"We stopped by the state park on our way from Destin to Panama City Beach, Florida. It was a rainy day, and since we were just passing through, we decided to take a look around. To be honest, we ended up staying in the car. We were about the only ones in the park, but due to the rainy weather, we decided just to get a quick look around. We definitely will be back!Due to the weather and our just driving through the area, the lady at the check-in house, gave us a 15 to 20 minute pass to take a look at all the attractions in the state park. That was so kind! We had stopped earlier at Henderson State Park to quickly look around, but we had to pay the entrance fee if we wanted to just take a quick drive through the park. We were very thankful that the lady let us see a quick view of the park on a 15 minute guest pass.The state park was covered with beautiful white sand dunes and a beautiful beach. To be honest, we were more captivated with the lake, as we were looking for alligators! We did not see any... The rest of the family was pretty pleased that we did not see any alligators lurking in the water! We did see the Ranger out and about, and we stopped to ask him a few questions. He was very kind!They do have a large area where you can camp and park RVs. I felt like it was a large enough state park that could occupy you and your family for a long amount of time. It seemed very clean and well taken care of. If it had been nicer weather and if we would've had more time, it would have been a great place to explore!

Swimming is only allowed in a small area, so be sure to be aware of the signage. The water is a little brackish near shore, and the beach is rocky and shelled, so definitely recommend wearing water shoes. But, you can't beat the views! The water and waves were a bit rough when I went, but the scenery was stunning!Warning tho, masks are not strictly enforced after entry (they are required to enter) and unfortunately many people are not respectful of social distancing.

BTW- The deeply knowledgeable Rangers charged me a whole $4 entry fee. $6 for a carload of folks.This morning the weather was so glorious it was time for a hike. I drove around the beautiful Loop road to access the Cypress Swamp Trail. Many folks consider it the best trail in the park. Just so you know, most of the trails here are relatively short, about thirty minutes walking. Some are on land and some are on catwalks. Cypress Swamp is mostly on catwalks. Beware that the walking is easy but sometimes the catwalks switch to a very narrow version. See my pictures. You need to keep your balance, or you'll be in a gaters swimming pool! That gaters warning sign at the beginning of the trail is not kidding!This morning I saw a couple of gators, a wild hog, a bunch of deer and Oh, a water moccasin. They are hard to take pictures of because they generally run, scurry, slither, or swim away as fast as they can but it's so incredible to see them!Sure, Florida is known world-wide for all its theme parks but this side of Florida is just as pleasurable, just in a different way!",Steven B.,5 star rating,"Orlando, FL",,Highlands Hammock State Park,yelp

In November no more swimming because the Manatees are coming home to warm up for a few months.So make sure to call to get details on what is open. We came to go tubbing, the water was a cool 72 degrees  oh so nice. I brought my own tubes and filled them up for a dollar at the park.  The tubbing is a short distance not like Itchetuckee spring that is a long tubbing experience. At the beginning you have to get ready for that cold water shock but afterwards you get  use to it. We stayed in the water for a few hours till our fingers shriveled .

10/24/2020,"Nice little beach in Key West but not for the faint of heart if you want to take a dip. It's very rough rocky terrain that we enjoyed watching people endlessly trip and fumble on (no one got hurt, we aren't monsters). It's no match for my ninja level balance and nimbleness so it was fine for me, but everyone else we saw struggled. So be forewarned. However there's not a ton of other options in the area. The best option though is probably the beach on the east side a little north of Duval. Best to drive or ride share though since it's a far walk. Anyways back to this beach you can rent a chair and umbrella for $25 or so I think it was and there's plenty of parking here. The walk from the parking lot to the beach isn't too far so you can carry stuff with you easy enough. There was a long line to get in though since you also have to pay at the gate. Don't be one of the fools that blocks the intersection that has signage everywhere and have a man come out and yell at you. It's better to come early to try and beat the rush. Or you can ride bikes in and get in much faster. The beach is open and long enough to take a nice stroll along the water. There's a shack that serves basic unhealthy fair food like burgers, chicken fingers and hotdogs so if you want something else or don't want to pay a premium price for trash food you'd better bring your own.",Michael W.,3 star rating,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",,Fort Zachary Taylor State Park Beach,yelp

It is nice to go see the farm every couple of months to see how the farm changes in the different seasons. Right now with the way things are, the farm is not being kept up to the usual standards, and the plantings are just not the same. In addition, the farm animals that are normally kept there are missing, most likely being kept somewhere else where it is more convenient. Some of the sights there are not open, like the main visiting center, but you still get a good feel for what the farm was like and get to see most of it.Walking around, the flowers were in bloom, as well as the Golden Orb spiders. Saw some incredible webs that they had produced. There were also a number of meadow spiders (cousins of the golden orb) spinning their webs, and some spinyback orb weavers (yet another cousin, commonly known as crab spiders though they have no relation to actual crab spiders).

11/9/2020,"Such a beautiful and massive park located right here in Central Florida, Blue Springs has something for just about everyone.  We have visited here to celebrate birthdays, utilizing their pavilions.  We have come here just as a family, to enjoy a day with nature.  With spring water, you know the deal.....72 degree brisk Florida swimming at its finest.  You can rent/bring a tube and leisurely float down the river, enjoying all that natural scenery.  Many times you will find divers at the spring head going down deep underwater.  Kayak rentals and canoe rentals are here, I haven't done them, but it appears you need to do so in advance.  They have on-site food there in case you are hungry, just the basic concession stand type stuff.  One word of caution, specifically with Covid at this time, the capacity is diminished here, and if you show up too late in the day, you will be waiting to get in.  We arrived just after opening and had no issue, but that may not always be the case.  One final note of awesomeness, they have firefly season, typically in April.  This is legit, and a rare thing for Florida.  You show up near dark, and once dark they take you along the trails of the park to see the show.  Thousands of fireflies are out, all different colors, it is truly a sight to see.  Make this a priority, you will not regret it.",Brian M.,5 star rating,"Apopka, FL",,Blue Spring State Park,yelp

11/9/2020,"Today was an incredible day although most are skeptics when it comes to time travel 2020 has offered up things far more bizarre - it all started with a empty parking lot then a walk along an abandoned path, it's as eire as the day after the world ended, if it weren't for the elderly masked lady working the booth I would say we were totally alone in this huge jurassic like park setting - we only needed to flash the yellow ticket we received when we checked into the campground a few days earlier to get passed her gaze, it's as if she didn't expect anyone to enter today, maybe she holds the keys to a period beyond the Mesozoic Epoch, being alone in such a space feel like the paranormal is alive, perhaps these are the days when ""Big Foot"" appears. The gift shop was dark with signs taped on the window stating it was closed until further notice, a few steps away are the plaques inscribed commemorating the park, a few steps further is the money shot for anyone with a camera the first view of the springs so breathtaking it's as if it was staged. Is it possible the park is completely void of visitors today, earlier reviews speak of early closure because of capacity issues by 8:00 am, over crowded walkways and the spring saturated with swimmers, I see none of this at 1:00 PM on this beautiful November day, there must be something else in play here, it's as if a pandemic has taken over our life's and we have stopped living, for me I believe the sun will rise tomorrow as it has for billions of years.Most of the waterfalls are turned off today, the steep artificial structures are dry and bare along the mossy brick paths, the greenery seems nourished but I reach down several times to bend a leaf or smell a flower to validate it's all real being every thing I've witnessed seems surreal up to this point. I climb the path and hear the unmistakable sound of falling water I continue the climb towards the trickling sounds and find a water fall operating as designed despite the drop in revenue and immediately the experience improves, the minnows are dancing in the ebb and flow as the water falls freely and is caught by the perfectly placed stones as it makes its way to the springs far below. I sit on a ledge and take it all in - I doubt many have experienced this place as I have today, void of visitors during normal business hours. It's enjoyable but strange, aren't these places created to be enjoyed - I miss the little ones running around screaming, the elementary one in awe of nature, the parents making excuses to why they can't have ice cream because they are about to eat lunch and the elderly sitting on a bench taking it all in - have we all been scared into something we never saw coming, it's been less than a year since the lines here ended to witness nature's beautiful.

11/19/2020,"This has by far become one of my favorite getaways. Since it requires a ferry for entry, the crowds are very minimal. I never have a problem getting an umbrella and they're very reasonably priced. (2 chairs and 2 umbrellas already set up for $29 total). There is signage that lets you know of the chop level of the water. There is a cafe on island that delivers. The attendant that handles the chairs also delivers the food. Til him well, he's awesome. And he always remembers me when I visit.The ferry process is straightforward and easy. It leaves every hour in the hour til about 4 and returns every hour on the 30 til about 5:15. At which point a search crew is later sent for you. Don't let that happen to you lol. The waters are very fun and the waves are big. You can walk pretty far out before it gets deep.

11/28/2020,"Like others have stated this SP is remote, it's definitely a destination, not a place you'll stumble upon unless you're lost of course. When we decided to visit the area over the Thanksgiving holiday the park was an option for camping but not the first option and that was mainly due to the accommodations when compared to the other options right outside the entrance to the park but that's another review.The admission is five bucks a car which is collected a few hundred yards from the main road - the ranger wasn't over friendly as he reach out for the payment using a six foot pole with a pail attached insisting on exact change then offered a map which he passed using the same method. These covid-19 protocols are really getting ridiculous I noticed he grabbed the bill without gloves how did he know I didn't just sneeze on it.The drive to the campgrounds, the park store, the marina, the observation tower, the pavilions pretty much everything is quite a drive, I think the loop is just over six miles at 15 m.p.h - I'm in no hurry the day is as beautiful as the drive. We drove through the campground to validate our decision to stay elsewhere, there's no doubt the value is here but living off the gray and black tanks for a week means super conservative measures since there are no sewer connections. I prefer not to carry a portable dump cart or moving the beast every few days requires a lot of effort especially when I'm supposed to be relaxing and having fun.Another park void of many visitors even on a holiday weekend, the campground seems nearly full but the park amenities aren't being utilized. I witnessed a number of park employees doing their daily chores, everything is so neat and tidy it's almost as if they've been assigned busy work to get their hours in. Like most business I'm sure the revenue had dropped off, fortunately for them the state subsidies them for now but I'm sure if this pandemic continues these places too will start shutting down or implement reduced hours. It's was an interesting drive - a nice place to walk and climb to the top of the observation tower.

11/30/2020,"Stunning area! It's really hard to figure out where to go though. We pulled into the main head springs entrance with the intention of launching our kayaks but we didn't see any other kayaks, just a bunch of people with pool noodles. We drove all the way around to the campground entrance but you can't get in there without an access code. I had to call the info number a few times before someone picked up. We drove back over to the main entrance and walked up to the entry area only to find out that the walk from the parking lot to the kayak launch was about 1/3-1/2 mile, half of it being uphill. Neither one of us were up for carrying two heavy kayaks that far so we paid the $2 pp entry fee and just walked around. The gift shop and restaurant are closed. The swimming area is pretty but very small and absolutely packed with dozens of kids. The kayaks and paddle boards for rent are really worn out. I feel like the park could make more money by having a more easily accessible launch site and charging to launch. We would've gladly paid $20 to launch our own kayaks but we couldn't justify spending so much to rent theirs. One thing I thought was funny was that everyone in the park was wearing masks, even while out on the water, but no one at any of the restaurants wears masks, not even the cooks and servers. Strange little town.

The park is close enough to town that we drove in to pick up a pizza for one night. We did not go onto the RV side of the park so I can't speak of that.

12/3/2020,"Lake Louisa is a great destination to unwind and enjoy nature. There are many miles of hiking trails for you to enjoy. You are also many other amenities to enjoy such as fishing, horseback riding, canoeing, kayaking, and cycling. There are many options for accommodations including RV sites, regular camp sites, ""primitive"" camping, ""glamping"" (glamorous camping), and even sites in which you can bring your own horses with a small corral. The state park also doesn't stay far from civilization and if you forgot to bring groceries there are supermarkets relatively close by, but you will need a car to get to them. It is also ideal to have either a car or golf cart to travel throughout the park because it is quite large to traverse on foot.There is a small convenience store that sells basic necessities and park merchandise. This is also where you go to rent the canoes and bicycles.I had the pleasure of being able to see lots of wildlife, including gopher tortoises and a doe and her little fawn.

12/4/2020,"This is a very large, comprehensive, trail system based on a former railbed. However, as the paved railbed trail is what is most-known of the Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail, I wish to draw attention to the fact that there are a number of smaller, unpaved, trails appropriate for hikers or mountain bikes intersecting with the main trail and located there for access from the main trail. The Susan Wright Trail is one of such and is very nice. There are also various viewing platforms along the way and the integration with Paynes Prairie is very good. It is perfectly possible to drive in a car to one of several trailheads, park, and go biking or running or hiking without doing the entire trail and I think that's what a lot of people use this trail for, especially runners. Bugs can be bad, even in cooler weather as much of the trail abuts swampy areas and for the same reason, the smaller, unpaved trails can be flooded or muddy after even moderate rains. You should also remain on the lookout for snakes as they tend to come to the paved trail to sun themselves.

It was a very scenic stroll and we saw lots of fish jumping. The beach itself was beautiful. It wasn't crowded at all and even felt like we had our own private area. The water was clear with no annoying patches of floating seaweed. The sand was also clean with no trash (we even saw a few volunteers with their beach clean up tools walking around).On our way back from the beach (around 11am), there were a few large groups making their way to the beach.

The kayaking is easy.You can rent or haul your own kayak from the parking lot.Kayak lunch is about 500 yards,so if you have the wheels to pull your kayak,you might want to use it.Kayak area gets kind of crowded,so if you are looking for peace and quiet it is adviced to head out early.We seen many beautiful birds,turtles,fish,alligators.The water is tranquil until Rock Creek where clear brown water gets mixed in with the clear waters of Wikiwa Springs.By the time you reach Wikiwa Island you won't able to see the bottom.Also the river gets pretty busy after the island,with John boats and pontoon tour boats going up and down.We also went up stream on Rock Creek,it was shallow but pretty fast flowing and we were going against the currant,so it is definitely more work than kayaking on Wikiwa Springs,however it was less crowded and it was super nice just to flote back to Wikiwa Springs.The whole kayaking took about 3 hours for us.Wikiwa Springs State Park is great park to check out if you are in the area!",E J.,5 star rating,"North Port, FL",,Wekiwa Springs State Park,yelp

We slept in tents but found the electricity to be quite useful for blowing up our air mattresses and one night I even used a heated blanket. Site 24 was by far our favorite as it is closest to the bathrooms (just a short trek through the wooded area). If we had not had this location we would have needed to walk all the way around to get to the bathrooms near sites 1 & 2. We felt it was close enough but yet far enough away not to hear the bathroom noises of doors slamming and hand dryers blowing. I would jot have wanted to be in a low number site. There is a fire pit at every campsite along with electric, a water spigot, and a picnic table. Some could say we were glamping and I'm okay with that. The bathroom area included two washer and dryers which took quarters, men's and woman's bathrooms which included showers and then one companion handicap accessible bathroom and shower combo. The bathrooms were very clean and looked to be newly remodeled. There is a sign that says they are cleaned and closed every day from 1-2, however we found this to vary depending on the day.

Despite the warning that we would very likely not see manatees in November here, several swam right by us and came to check us out. One even swam right under my kayak - which was the coolest things ever! The mangroves were gorgeous, and the tour guide was genuine, knowledgeable, and fun. He explained all about the different types of mangroves, the different creatures we encountered, and more that we should be on the lookout for. After the kayak tour and dropping into the adorable gift shop, my mom and I walked down the short and scenic path to the beach.

12/21/2020,"I need to update my review--as it happens, I was the first person to review this park here on Yelp when it was in private hands back in 2011 and a lot has changed now that it is instead under State Parks' ownership.In general, I love Florida's State Parks, I really do. I have to say however that they have taken several things away from Blue Springs that I really loved about it, one being the dive platform. There are apparently no more dive platforms at any State Park springs nowadays: at one time, Fanning Springs and Madison Blue Springs both had nice dive platforms. Apparently they were removed for liability reasons which I find really stupid: post a warning, say you are diving at your own risk, and if someone sues because their kid broke his leg sic the State Attorney on them and eat them and their lawyers alive. In the Nordic nations you pretty much can just post a warning and say ""do this at your own risk, we're immune from torts"" and that's that. And that's also how it should be in the USA. We're not a very free country when a whole state is afraid of being sued because little Tommy pushed little Billy off the dive platform and now they're suing, are we now?The other thing they removed was the boardwalk, or to be more exacting, they took out most of it but left some of it in place. The boardwalk once ran all the way from around the spring down the spring run to the Santa Fe River. I do not know why the lion's share of the boardwalk was removed by the State Parks but I guess it may have to do with the restoration efforts of aquatic vegetation they're doing now (which I fully support the restoration and conservation work, but the boardwalk was a real hi-light of this park).So all in all, it's still a really beautiful spring and it is more focused now on being a nature experience which is in keeping with the overall mission of our State Parks. I'm sad about the changes however, it's just not as fun as it used to be. Some good news though is the price of admission, as a State Park, is around five or six dollars vs ten when it was private.",Mike W.,3 star rating,"Savannah, GA",,Gilchrist Blue Springs State Park,yelp

12/29/2020,"Beautiful state park that is well maintained with a garden area and multiple trails. Nice for a day outside especially during the current situation. There is a river where boats pass by that you can walk near and view plenty of birds, plants, etc. the rose garden and fountains are especially nice and calming. Would definitely visit again if I was in the area. $5 to enter for the day.",Vishall S.,5 star rating,"Orlando, FL",,Washington Oaks Gardens State Park,yelp
12/30/2020,Most beautiful park in Florida? Absolutely!!!! Highlands hammock is absolutely beautiful!!!!! A friend had posted some camping pictures and I was intrigued. So glad we took the drive. The playground/bathroom area was very clean and so pretty. It really was. It was surrounded by beautiful trees. It felt like we were out of Florida. Loved all the trails. The cypress one was by far my favorite ever. Loved it so much we did it twice. Every trail is marked and pretty family friendly. Worth the visit 100%. I did not see the campgrounds but I'm sure they are beautiful.,Frances R.,5 star rating,"Miami, FL",,Highlands Hammock State Park,yelp
12/30/2020,"Okay park.  Trails are a little boring.  Didn't see any wildlife except for a couple nesting tortoises.Being in season now, the park was full, so we had to park outside and walk in.  Still have to pay, even when you walk in.",Jeff W.,3 star rating,"Fort Myers, FL",,Lovers Key State Park,yelp
